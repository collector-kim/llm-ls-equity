2024, Q1, 2024-05-14,"Operator: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Nu Holdings conference call to discuss the results for the first quarter of 2024. A slide presentation is accompanying today's webcast, which is available in Nu's Investor Relations website, www.investor.nu in English and www.investidores.nu in Portuguese. This conference is being recorded, and the replay can also be accessed on the company's IR website. This call is also available in Portuguese.  [Operator Instructions] [Foreign Language] 
 [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jorg Friedemann, Investor Relations Officer at Nu Holdings. Mr. Friedemann, you may proceed. 
Jorg Friedemann: Thank you very much, operator. and thank you all for joining our earnings call today. If you have not seen our earnings release, a copy is posted in the Results Center section of our Investor Relations website. With me on today's call are David Velez, our Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; Youssef Lahrech, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Guilherme Lago, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jag Duggal, our Chief Product Officer. 
 Throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-IFRS financial information, including adjusted net income. These are important financial measures for Nu, but are not financial measures as defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures from other companies. Reconciliations of our non-IFRS financial information to the IFRS financial information are available in our earnings press release. Unless noted otherwise, all growth rates are on a year-over-year FX-neutral basis. 
 I would also like to remind everyone that today's discussion might include forward-looking statements, which are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.
 Please refer to the forward-looking statements disclosure in our earnings release. Today, our Founder, Chairman and CEO, David Velez, will discuss the main highlights of our first quarter 2024. Subsequently, Guilherme Lago, our CFO; and Youssef Lahrech, our President and COO,  will take you through our financial and operating performance for the quarter. After which time, we will be happy to take your questions. Now I'd like to turn the call over to David. David, please go ahead. 
David Velez-Osomo: Thank you, Jorg. Good evening, everyone, and thank you again for being with us today. In Q1 2024, we kick started the year with many ambitious goals aimed at propelling our platform to the next level. As we shared with you last quarter, we're targeting 4 key priorities for 2024, all aligned with our mission to find complexity and empower people: First, establish strong momentum in Mexico, which means creating the basis for us to grow sustainably and profitably in the country; second, ramp up our secure lending initiatives in Brazil; third, enhance our strategies to further advance in the high-income segment in Brazil; and fourth, launch products and services to leverage technologies such as real-time payments, open banking and AI that will turn the concept of our consumer technology-driven money platform into a reality for our customers. 
 Beginning this quarter, we will present data points to demonstrate the progress of select priorities. During Q1 2024, our business model, anchoring 3 fundamental principles: fast customer expansion; expanding revenue per customer; and efficient operating costs showed its strength once again as we generated significant earnings. The growth of our customer base on a net add basis continues to exceed our expectations, surpassing 99 million customers at the end of the quarter, expanding 67% from the 59 million recorded just 2 years ago.
 In fact, we've recently announced surpassing the milestone of 100 million customers, becoming the first digital banking platform outside of Asia to cross this remarkable number and operating still in only 3 countries in Latin America. The rate of customer net adds in Brazil continues to be impressive, averaging 1.3 million customers per month, resulting in a total of 91.8 million customers at the end of the first quarter of 2024.
 In parallel, our growth in Mexico has reaccelerated with a net add of almost 1.5 million new customers in the quarter, reaching a total of 6.6 million customers by the end of Q1. This growth underscores the success of our decision to increase the positive yields in Mexico, which has accelerated our flywheel and solidified Nu's position as the unrivaled leader in the digital banking category in Mexico.
 Finally, let me share some financial highlights with you. In the quarter, our revenues surged to $2.7 billion, accelerating sequentially to a 64% year-over-year increase. Our gross profit surpassed $1.2 billion, growing 76% year-over-year, while our gross margin reached 43.2% in the quarter. Despite expected contraction of our gross margins this quarter from a seasonal high in Q4, as flagged during our prior earnings call, our net income expanded again quarter-over-quarter to $379 million, while we achieved adjusted net income of $443 million, reflecting expansions of 160% and 136% year-over-year, respectively.
 This showcases the strength of our business model, capable of combining strong online growth with consistently very solid levels of profitability. This slide encapsulates our financial performance trends over the past 2 years, underscoring our momentum and consistent success in expanding our customer base while simultaneously accelerating both revenues and profitability. The robust growth for our customer base, driven by the growing cross-selling and upselling opportunities enabled by our highly engaged platform led to more than threefold increase in quarterly revenues within just 2 years on an FX-neutral basis. 
 This translated into a 75% annual compounded growth rate for this period. The third chart on this slide effectively illustrates our robust pricing and underwriting capabilities, where quarterly gross profit is calculated as total revenues minus funding costs, transactional expenses and credit loss allowances increased by almost 4x in the same period. 
 Lastly, the combined impact of the aforementioned factors, coupled with the strong operating leverage of our platform and the maturation of our early products in Brazil, has led to a significant acceleration in net income growth. This upward trajectory is evident in the chart on the right, especially over the past 2 years. We anticipate this compounding effect to persist in the years ahead, driven by the combination of sustained growth and increased profitability within our platform. 
 Now I'd like to highlight how our flywheel, not only drives customer acquisition and data growth, but also sustains strong momentum in our key financial metrics. As we continue to expand in our 3 markets, leveraging the inherent operating advantage of our model, our holding company has successfully transformed its potential into profits. 
 In the first quarter of the year, Nu Holdings achieved an adjusted net income of $443 million, reflecting an adjusted annualized return on equity of 27%. We believe that this performance surpasses that of most peers in the region, despite maintaining a considerable excess capital of $2.4 billion at the holding level and with 2 subsidiaries in Mexico and Colombia that are still operating with negative profitability. If one were to look at our operations in Brazil alone, our return on equity remained well above 40%.
 As outlined at the outset of this call, we are committed to providing investors in the market in general with updates on our progress regarding our 4 key priorities for 2024. For this quarter, we have chosen to present KPIs specifically related to our first priority, Mexico. In this slide, we highlight the considerable momentum our strategy in Mexico has achieved, evidenced by the acceleration of our flywheel in the country. Notably, Mexico is already surpassing Brazil in terms of time to achieve different key KPIs for the business.
 This slide was built analyzing quarterly figures in Mexico in Q1 '24, marking 19 quarters since our launch in Mexico and compares the status of our operations in Brazil at the same point in time. After just 1 year since the launch of Cuenta Nu, Mexico has already surpassed Brazil in both absolute number of customers and checking account holders as well as in relative terms when considering market share figures. Equally impressive is the progress for credit card franchise in Mexico.
 Surpassing the milestone of 3 million credit card customers, we believe our user numbers have outpaced those of some of the top 3 incumbent banks in the country. Notably, Nu Mexico has already attained $1.6 billion in credit card purchase volume, representing a 6.1% market share in the country compared to a 4.3% share in Brazil during the same period. When looking into deposits, we have just crossed the mark of $2.3 billion of retail deposits, more than double the amount at the end of 2023 and representing 1.2% share of total deposits in Mexico compared to the 0.5% we had in Brazil at the same time.
 The aforementioned KPIs dropped $149 million in total revenues for Mexico this quarter, which compared to $99 million for Brazil in the same time frame. We're thrilled with our performance in the early months of 2024 and are well positioned to achieve the goals we have set for ourselves for the year. 
 The developments we've shared suggest that we are building a model that could be successfully exported, a feat many previously deemed unachievable in consumer finance. While we acknowledge that there are still many hurdles to overcome, we remain incredibly excited about the early stages of these model's development. Having successfully balanced growth and profitability in Brazil, we now aspire to extend these traits beyond our initial borders. 
 Now I'd like to pass the floor to our CFO, Guilherme Lago, who will guide you through our financial numbers. Over to you, Lago. 
Guilherme Marques do Lago: Thank you, David, and good evening, everyone. As David mentioned, we delivered a strong first quarter in both operating and financial KPIs. Those results were achieved by focusing on our simple yet powerful value-generating strategy, which can be summarized by 3 guiding pillars: First, a focus on growing our customer base in the 3 markets where we operate and rapidly converting our new customers into active customers; second, expanding average revenue per active customers, or ARPAC, through both cross-selling and upselling; and third, continuing to deliver high growth while maintaining one of the lowest operating costs in the industry. 
 Now let's delve further into our first quarter results to gain a deeper understanding on the progression of each one of these pillars. I will begin with the results of our customer acquisition. During the first quarter of 2024, our customer base continued to increase at a solid pace. We accelerated customer growth quarter-over-quarter, welcoming 5.5 million new customers in the first quarter of 2024 for a total of 99.3 million customers at quarter end, a 26% increase year-over-year.
 In Brazil alone, our customer growth pace is at approximately 1.3 million customers per month with the vast majority still coming from referrals. This not only translates into lower acquisition costs, but also ensures faster activation, showcasing the trust and satisfaction our customers have in our services. Our client base in both Mexico and Colombia also experienced strong positive growth.
 In Mexico, we reached 6.6 million customers this quarter, marking a remarkable 106% year-over-year growth and surpassing last quarter's net additions. Additionally, we now serve more than 900,000 customers in Colombia. Once we add customers, our goal is to activate and retain them. Our active customer base has increased by 27% year-over-year, followed by another sequential quarterly increase in the monthly activity rate, which now stands at 83.2%, up from 82.1% just 1 year ago. This marks the tenth consecutive increase in this metric. We believe that this is a testament to our proficiency in engaging customers effectively on our platform. 
 Turning our attention to revenue expansion. The first chart highlights that Nu has established primary banking relationships with around 59% of our active customer base. The drop of 2 percentage points in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2023 is mainly associated with last quarter's seasonality, considering increased transactionality during the month of December. Nevertheless, the 2 following charts show an increase in both the number of products per active customer and ARPAC. 
 As you can see in the second chart, the number of products per active customers grew from an average of 4 last quarter to 4.1 this quarter, illustrating our successful cross-selling strategy achieved by introducing new products to our customers and establishing ourselves as their primary banking partner. The last chart shows the combined effect of these 2 dynamics. By having significant customer engagement, as demonstrated in the first chart, together with our growing product cross-sell capabilities, as shown in the second chart, it produces increasingly positive results. 
 Our monthly ARPAC increased to $11.4 this quarter in comparison to $10.6 just 1 quarter ago. Our more mature cohorts are already generating a monthly ARPAC of $27. This reported increase in ARPAC resulted in another quarter of solid revenue growth as presented in the next slide. Our monthly ARPAC grew sequentially and accelerated its year-over-year expansion rate to 30%, reaching $11.4, up from $8.6 just 1 year ago. As discussed in prior earnings calls, we maintain confidence in further growing ARPAC going forward towards its full potential.
 In the second chart, we illustrate our revenues hit a new record high this quarter, reaching $2.7 billion, up 64% year-over-year. Just a year ago, our revenue was $1.6 billion. This growth was driven by the increase in active clients, combined with higher ARPAC levels. Now let's discuss our cards business in more detail. It's important to remember that for cards, the purchase volumes are seasonal, higher in the fourth quarter and lower in the first quarter of every year. Historical seasonality analysis shows a drop of 6.9% on average in total purchase volume for the industry.
 However, the sequential reduction in Nu's purchase volume this quarter was only 3.7%, with especially strong performance in credit cards, which contracted only 1.8% on an FX-neutral basis versus the historical industry seasonality drop of 5.9%. Compared to the first quarter of last year, our purchase volume was up 30% on an FX-neutral basis to $31.1 billion, sustaining its very strong growth path.
 On the right side, the chart shows how purchase volumes expand as cohorts of customers develop and mature. Older cohorts continue to increase purchase volumes. While an initial disparity does exist between newer and older cohorts, both tend to exhibit an upward trend in consumption over time. We expect that the compounding effect of adding millions of customers each month, along with the maturation of new customers into historically observed spending patterns, will strongly support the growth of future purchase volumes at Nubank. 
 Talking about purchase volumes trend for the industry, we believe Nu ended the first quarter of 2024 with a market share of around 15%, including credit, debit and prepaid cards. As we continue to attract millions of new customers every quarter and their spending matures over time, our confidence in our ability to capture additional market shares in the future only grows. 
 This quarter, our consumer finance portfolio, comprising credit cards and personal loans, posted another acceleration, growing 52% year-over-year and reaching $19.6 billion. This growth was boosted by expansions in both product categories. The credit card portfolio expanded sequentially, growing by 42% year-over-year to $15.1 billion. This growth was driven by the combined effect of onboarding new customers and increasing the share of wallet of existing customers across all segments. For yet another quarter, our personal loan portfolio was a highlight, increasing 88% year-over-year and reaching $4.5 billion. Following the consistent trends observed in previous quarters, our personal loan cohorts have continued to exhibit expected credit behaviors, which has enabled us to continue to scale originations. 
 Now let's move to the breakdown of interest-earning loans within our credit card portfolio. Interest-earning installment balances now account for 26% of our total credit card portfolio, up from 23% last quarter. This sequential growth was mainly underpinned by the successful expansion of our PIX and boletos financing products. As we previously mentioned, we believe that this type of financing offers an attractive risk-adjusted rate of return, allowing us to further expand the monetization of our credit card business, while also unlocking substantial value as we fulfill an important customer need.
 This strategy is reinforced by the fact that our share of revolving receivables has not increased, representing 6% of our total receivables again this quarter. Delving into our personal loan business, our portfolio composed of both unsecured and secured loans remains aligned with our expectations for asset quality.  Originations reached BRL 12.3 billion in the quarter with secured personal loans growing according to plan and originations reaching BRL 1.7 billion, almost doubling versus the prior quarter. This represents 14% of the total originated versus 10% in the previous quarter.
 As discussed in the previous earnings call, we are very pleased to note significant progress in broadening our lending portfolio. We have introduced payroll loans for federal public servants and retirees, FGTS anticipation and investment-backed loans. Although still ramping up, this portfolio should contribute to the development of an even more resilient credit book in the years to come.
 Following the same trend as last quarter, our credit yield was affected by the loan mix as secured personal loans have lower interest rates and increase in originations of these loans directly impact the average interest rate of our personal loan portfolio. This decrease in credit yield was only partially offset by a slight increase in the unsecured lending yield as a result of our continued risk expansions.
 Now let's review the progress achieved on the funding front. It's important to remember that fourth quarters are seasonally strong in deposit inflows, while first quarters are seasonally weak, representing a historical drop of approximately 4.6%. While we noted an expected decrease in deposits in Brazil, the total for the quarter of our deposits base increased and reached $24.3 billion, representing a 53% year-over-year growth, mainly driven by Mexico, where we are experiencing significant growth in Cuenta Nu. 
 By the end of the first quarter of 2024, we achieved over $2 billion in deposits in Mexico, more than doubling when compared to last quarter. Similar to Brazil, this growth represents a very significant milestone towards our goal of developing one of the strongest local currency retail deposit franchise in the region, bolstering our ability to support our consumer finance operations across all of the geos where we operate. Our cost of deposits, defined as the ratio between the interest income paid to customers and the interbank rate of the respective markets, namely TIIE for Mexico and CDI for Brazil, was 84% of the interbank rate, very much in line with our expectations. 
 The increase in cost of deposits this quarter is directly linked to the growth of our franchise in Mexico. We believe this consistently low cost of deposits highlights our progress in harnessing the value of our liability franchise. Our loan-to-deposit ratio, or LDR, stood at 40% versus 34% in the previous quarters with deposit growth accelerating sequentially.  We are very confident that there is still a lot of room for additional balance sheet optimization. 
 Net interest income, or NII, nearly doubled year-on-year, reaching another record high of $1.6 billion. This was driven by the growth of our credit card and lending portfolios, which collectively have propelled the expansion of our NII and of our net interest margins, or NIM, to new record highs. For the first quarter of 2024, we delivered a net interest margin of 19.5%, representing an increase of 1.2 percentage points compared to last quarter and a 4.5 percentage points in comparison to 1 year ago.
 As we look ahead and irrespective of the direction of interest rates, we believe that the main lever for future NIMs should be the progression of the company's loan-to-deposit ratio. As our excess deposits are invested in public bonds, the remuneration of which is much lower than those of our credit products. Let's turn our attention to the last pillar of our overall strategy, maintaining a low cost-to-serve. We maintain our conviction that our platform is one of the most cost-effective in catering to customers within our operating markets with its low cost-to-serve standing as a significant competitive advantage. 
 That is the reason we aim at keeping it at or below $1 level for the foreseeable future. For yet another quarter, we were successful in achieving this goal with a cost-to-serve per active customer standing at $0.90. This figure currently remains unchanged on an FX-neutral basis when compared to a year ago, while our ARPAC, as mentioned earlier, increased by 30%, demonstrating the strong operating leverage of our business model. Our gross profit reached a new quarterly record high at approximately $1.2 billion, a 76% year-over-year increase.
 As we mentioned during our last earnings call, we expected annualized gross margins to normalize to levels of 2023 as our investments in Mexico and Colombia are offset by the positive trends expected for Brazil. The sequential drop in gross profit margins in the first quarter was driven by 2 main factors: Number one, the seasonal drop in cards purchase volumes, which impacted interchange revenues when compared to the fourth quarter; and number two, the increase in growth, which drove credit loss allowance billed in the quarter. Yet, our gross profit margins reached 43.2% this quarter, an increase of 3 percentage points in comparison to 1 year ago. 
 One of the key elements of our strategy is achieving operating leverage. Our efficiency ratio stood at 32.1% during the first quarter of 2024, an improvement of almost 4 percentage points in relation to the last quarter of 2023 and almost 7 percentage points better than 1 year ago. Please recall that during the fourth quarter of 2023, our efficiency ratio was impacted by higher marketing expenses, mainly due to the phasing of this cost into the end of the year, together with higher cloud expenses, driven by seasonal increases in data usage in the quarter.
 As we mentioned at the time, we believe that our efficiency ratio would come to normalize during the following quarters, as demonstrated during this first quarter of 2024. We continue to believe that this positions Nu as one of the most efficient financial services companies in the world. We expect to benefit from the full potential of our platform's operating leverage as we continue to grow our customer base, upsell and cross-sell products, launch new features and eventually achieve profitability in the new geos of Mexico and Colombia, which are still in their investment phases.
 Let's now review the sustainable advantages across our 4 cost pillars: Number one, our cost to acquire was stable at $7, an amount we continue to believe to be one of the lowest among consumer fintechs and banks globally; number two, our cost-to-serve remained as expected at a low level, below $1, which we estimate to be approximately 85% lower than those of incumbent banks. Once again, we believe this level of cost to serve makes Nu one of the most efficient financial services companies in the world. 
 Number three, on cost of risk, again, we have effectively managed credit risk outperforming competitors on an apples-to-apples basis in terms of delinquency rates; and finally, number four, on the cost of funding, while significantly increasing deposit volumes, we were able to maintain our cost of funding at a competitive level of 84% of the blended interbank rates of Brazil and Mexico, thus closing the negative gap against incumbent banks and widening the positive gap over consumer fintechs.
 And finally, moving to net income. We delivered another quarter of profitability with a net income of $379 million, increasing by 160% compared to the previous year. This strong and positive results serve as an evidence of the effectiveness of our strategy and business model. Additionally, adjusted net income reached $443 million in the quarter and 136% increase when compared to 1 year ago. While we are encouraged by the first quarter results, it's again important to emphasize our commitment to managing our business for long-term value creation. This may require undertaking material short-term investments aimed at optimizing our long-term opportunities. 
 Now I would like to hand the call over to Youssef, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will walk you through the key highlights of our asset quality. 
Youssef Lahrech: Thank you, Lago. Good evening, everyone. I will now take you through some of the highlights of asset quality and credit portfolio health for the first quarter of 2024.  Let us start with NPL trends. First, let me remind you that seasonally, the first quarter represents a high point for early-stage delinquencies. Specifically, 15 to 90 NPLs rise on average by 80 basis points between Q4 and Q1 based on historical data, in line with the rest of the market. That being said, our leading indicator, NPL 15 to 90, increased to 5% in the first quarter of 2024, broadly in line with expectations.
 Second, our 90-plus NPL ratio increased slightly to 6.3%, also in line with expectations. This is a result of the normal flow through the delinquency buckets. Considering that, as we discussed in the past, 90-plus is a stock rather than flow metric, so over time, you get a stacking dynamic. And since we haven't sold any delinquent loans, our NPL rates require no adjustment. 
 As we've mentioned in previous calls, we continue to see meaningful opportunities to expand our credit portfolio, aiming for attractive returns and robust resilience. Part of that growth has been coming from expansions than the credit spectrum, which will continue to result in intentionally higher delinquency rates and will continue to be more than offset by additional revenues leading to increasing risk-adjusted margins over time. To illustrate the impact of the credit expansion dynamic on our consumer finance portfolio, we're sharing here this analysis of NPLs as a ratio of interest-earning balances only as opposed to total balances in the previous slide. 
 As you can appreciate, Nu's NPLs as a ratio of interest-earning balances have been trending significantly down on both 15 to 90 and 90-plus. In other words, as we've expanded our credit portfolio, we have increased interest-earning balances at a faster rate than NPLs, thus enhancing returns and resilience. Our provisions continue to grow, primarily driven by the growth in our portfolio, following the same dynamic as in prior quarters. This is, again, due to the fact that we front-load provisions when we originate loans in accordance with IFRS 9's expected loss methodology. 
 Our credit loss allowance expenses grew to $831 million this quarter, directly linked to the increased volumes of origination we generated in the quarter. As a reminder, last quarter, we incurred a lower credit loss allowance expense. That suppression was driven by higher credit card and personal loan recoveries as a result of the Desenrola government-sponsored debt renegotiation program in Brazil, combined with other collections initiatives. 
 Risk-adjusted NIM reached 9.5% in the quarter, up 3.2 percentage points from a year ago, although contracting 70 basis points quarter-on-quarter. The risk-adjusted NIM was directly impacted by the increase of provisions linked to the growth of our portfolio, particularly in Brazil and by the growth of our deposits in Mexico. Excluding these 2 effects, our risk-adjusted NIM would have been virtually changed versus the past quarter. With that, we're now ready to address your questions. Thank you very much. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jorg Friedemann, Investor Relations Officer. 
Jorg Friedemann: Our first question comes from the line of Tito Labarta at Goldman Sachs. 
Daer Labarta: My question is on the increase in provisions. I understand part of it, Desenrola impacted 4Q, so expecting some part of an increase. But if you can maybe delineate a little bit more the sharp increase in the quarter. Is it a function of the loan mix, thinking interest-bearing credit card portfolio increased more, personal loans increased a lot? And did Mexico have any impact on the provisioning? Just to think about -- how we should think about it going forward as well. 
Youssef Lahrech: Tito, thanks for your question. So in terms of the provision dynamics and the provision build we saw in the quarter, you're definitely correct to point out that last quarter was a little bit abnormally low because of the Desenrola we had indicated about $60 million to $70 million additional recoveries during the quarter. So you have to think about over last quarter with that in mind. This quarter, we were back to what I would describe as more normal levels that reflect the dynamics of the portfolio. So we've experienced a lot of growth in both lending, secured and unsecured as well as credit card.
 Some of that growth, as [ I pointed out earlier ], comes from credit expansions, and we've typically seen that play out per expectations, if not actually slightly better than our expectations in terms of the returns. So we're very happy with the NPV and the returns we're getting from those expansions, and you can see that reflected in the risk-adjusted NIM, growing 320 basis points year-on-year.
 With respect to Mexico, in fact, in Mexico, what we're seeing in the last couple of quarters is improvements in NPLs, partly because of the underwriting improvements we've made at our models, more data. There's more experience in the market and then partly because of a better mix of customers we've been getting over the last couple of quarters after repricing the Cuenta yield up. So Mexico has been probably a positive driver rather than not on that front. 
Daer Labarta: Great. That's helpful. And my follow-up, I guess, on the risk-adjusted NIM, you mentioned it would have been stable-ish sort of quarter-over-quarter adjusting for Desenrola. Is that sort of maybe what we should expect for the full year? Or do you think there can be some risk-adjusted NIM expansion throughout the year? I know you don't give guidance, but just how you think that should evolve, to some extent, would be helpful. 
Youssef Lahrech: Yes, sure. So Tito, you're correct. Like, the risk adjusted NIM going forward will reflect kind of dynamics of the portfolio -- the credit portfolio going forward. If we -- like we have, over the last couple of quarters, continue to see opportunities to expand. That would come with enhanced margins, right? But we, as you pointed out, don't give guidance on that nor try to forecast that with any degree of precision. 
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Thiago Batista from UBS. 
Thiago Bovolenta Batista: I have a question about the SME business of Nu. We saw that Nu achieved more than 4 million clients in the SME business, something close to 2.4 active clients in this segment. When I look at  Central Bank data, Nu is charging about 9%, 10% per month in these short-term working capital loans. This is probably a very small portfolio for Nu right now. But  can you share with us Nu's strategy in this segment? And how big this can be in the future? 
David Velez-Osomo: Thank you for the question. So you're right. We actually haven't really talked publicly that much about our growth on the SME side, but it is a significant opportunity ahead of us. And partly, this opportunity has come to fruition as we started to cross-selling SME account to our large consumer base. So just to give you one data point, out of the 93 million or so Brazilian customers that we have, we think we have in our base, something like 8 million or 9 million small businesses, and that's a significant percentage of something like 15 million of total businesses existing in Brazil. 
 So already in our base, we have a path towards pretty significant operation with more businesses. We, by the way, see that they tend to be very badly served also, especially if they are owned by 1 shareholder or 2 shareholders. So as we call here in Brazil, [ May ]. So this is a big opportunity that we've been developing as it has grown consistently. Today, our value proposition is fairly basic. We began with an account for the small business, then we launched a debit card.
 We have already started growing for a few quarters, the credit card for the small business. This is a product that we're very excited about because we get to use a lot of the credit and the rating data that we have on the consumer side for the small business side. There actually is a lot of synergies in using a lot of the data for both sides of the consumer. It allows us to see a consumer more -- on a more complete basis. 
 And we also see that when we start banking somebody both on the consumer side as well as the small business, we see a pretty significant increase in ARPAC. We see a higher increase in engagement. We see higher activation. So it, not only adds additional ARPAC, it brings a lot of synergies to the platform as a whole. In terms of working capital loans, we are just beginning to test that product. It's tiny in our base. It is something that we are ramping up slowly. And we're testing a number of different secured and unsecured products for the small business, but we haven't really rolled out anything big yet. 
Guilherme Marques do Lago: The only thing, Thiago, that I would add to that is that similarly to the profit pool that we see in consumers, the profit pool that we estimate to exist in SME is still 65% to 70% driven by credit. And within credit, we started with credit card for SMEs. The credit card business is performing extremely well. We are super encouraged by the early results, and then we are gradually expanding into working capital.
 What we expect, however, in SME is that differently, for example, from the public payroll on market, is not necessarily a market in which our growth will hinge on someone else losing market share. We think there's a tremendous opportunity to increase the size of the pie within the credit penetration in the Brazilian SME space. It still has very low penetration and we think we can expand the market quite strongly. 
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous. 
Geoffrey Elliott: Can you  hear me? Sorry, I think I had to click a couple of times to unmute. Can you hear me now? 
Jorg Friedemann: Yes, we can hear you now. 
Geoffrey Elliott: Great. Share-based compensation was quite a bit higher this quarter than it has been. Can you just remind us of the dynamics that is the share price a driver? Is it about grant? What's going on? What drives that? And how should we think about it on a normalized level? 
Guilherme Marques do Lago: Geoff, this is Lago. Thanks for the question. Yes, we had an increase in share-based compensation. And, I think, it is largely the result of 3 compounding effects. I think number one is there's a general head count growth in the company. Number two is the result of more aggressive performance recognition than we did in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the first quarter of 2023. And number three, the share appreciation, which negatively impacts our social tax contributions, primarily in Brazil, which can account for up to 36% of the grants.
 So as you will see our explanatory notes for the financial statements, you will note the increase in share-based compensation, but also the corresponding increase in shared taxes and social contribution taxes, which are accounted together with share-based compensation. Now one of the things, Geoff, that we take very seriously is the net and gross dilution that we apply to our shareholders. And if you take a look at our gross and net burn rates, we have been operating below 100 basis points. In fact, over the past 2 years, we have been operating below 60 basis points.
 And we believe, the number one, that we are in the bottom quartile of the industry in terms of companies that apply the lowest levels of dilution to our shareholders. And number two, as we increase in size and value, we do expect operating leverage to continue to play its part here, so we expect that this number will actually go down over time. 
Geoffrey Elliott: And in terms of what to think about as a normalized figure there. I guess we would want to take out the share price appreciation. It's probably not going to be up 40% every quarter. So what can you point us to, to get to a more normal figure? 
Guilherme Marques do Lago: So we don't provide guidance on that. But if you take a look at explanatory note #10 of our financial statements, you will note -- and you will see how much of that increase came from share price appreciation they are more or less. So you can exclude the number from the total share-based compensation. We do, however, pay much closer attention, Geoff, to our net and gross burn rates. And we think, on that note, one should easily expect that this will be meaningfully below 100 basis points per year. 
Jorg Friedemann: Our next question comes from the line of Gustavo Schroden from Bradesco BBI. 
Gustavo Schroden: I'd like to explore a little bit the NIM. Indeed, that was a very impressive NIM in the quarter. But I would like to understand the trends and the moving parts here. Because if one side, we have an increase in the cost of funding from 80% to 84%, on the other hand, if we analyze specifically the personal loans average interest rates declined from 6.4% to 6.2%. So I am assuming here that the difference here or the positive is coming from the other products such as the credit card installments, revolvings -- revolving and also some trading gains or  other products. 
 So my question is, could you give us more color on these other products if you are raising interest rates in these other products to offset this, let's say, kind of a pressure if we compare the cost of funding versus the personal loans? I'm asking this because I can see that the secured loans are gaining share in your portfolio. So any color on that would be great. 
Guilherme Marques do Lago: Gustavo, this is Lago. Thanks so much for your question. I think you are referring to Slide #17 in our earnings presentation. And yes, we have experienced what we believe to be a relatively strong expansion in net interest margin. Over the past 4 quarters, it went from about 15% to 19.5%. And it is largely the result of 2 opposing forces. I think on one aspect, on one side, you do have the optimization of the balance sheet in Brazil. As you see the expansion of our loan-to-deposit ratio going from 30% to 35%, then to 40%, you should generally expect to see net interest margins going up. 
 And even though you've mentioned that secured personal loans have lower yield levels than unsecured and also lower interest levels than credit cards, they do have materially higher yields than the treasury bonds in which we deploy most of our excess cash. So as we shift part of our treasury in treasuries to interest-earning assets of consumer finance, you should expect to see net interest margins expanding in Brazil.
 The offsetting force to which I alluded before is our operations in Mexico and Colombia, in which we are paying, as of today, deposit rates that are slightly higher than the interbank deposit rates in those countries, which bring the net interest margins down on one side. So I think going forward, those 2 offsetting forces will play out, we do expect to see net interest margin to continue to expand on average in the coming quarters. 
Gustavo Schroden: That's very clear, Lago. Just a follow-up here. What is the -- let's say, the level of loan-to-deposit ratio we should use in our model to -- in my opinion, according to your answer, that should be a good proxy or a good variable to forecast and trying to get the best NIM in the future. So if you could share with us what is the good level of loan-to-deposit ratio would be great as well. 
Guilherme Marques do Lago: Yes. So, I mean, a good reference more than a guidance is the loan-to-deposit ratio of the large retail in common banks in Latin America is between 100% to 110%. I don't expect that we will get to a loan-to-deposit ratio anywhere close to those levels, but it will be materially higher than the 40% that we presented in the last quarter. 
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Jorge Kuri of Morgan Stanley. 
Jorge Kuri: Congrats on the numbers. I wanted to see if you could maybe double-click on your loan-to-customer growth during the quarter. It was really impressive, 21% quarter-on-quarter on the total balance. You also disclosed your originations going from BRL 1 billion to BRL 1.7 billion. How much of that is attributed to the early success of your payroll loans? How much of that is FGTS continue to develop the personal loans business? 
 Anything that you can help us understand what is the look and feel of this very big uptick in personal loans would be -- in loan to customers, sorry, would be very helpful. And again, I think the market's very excited about the prospects for payroll loans. So to what extent that is included here? And what can you tell us about this whole growth? 
Guilherme Marques do Lago: Jorge, Thanks for the question. This is Lago. I think we are very pleased with the evolution of the total portfolio growth that we have presented. I would point you to Slide 36 of our earnings presentation, in which we provide more details on the breakdown between personal loans and credit card growth. And one of the things that you will note is that irrespective of the seasonality, we have been posting fairly robust growth in our credit card book. 
 In fact, by the end of the first quarter of 2024, we estimate that our market share in cards, in general, has reached about 15%, 1-5, which would place Nubank as the second credit card issuer in the country, and we continue to acquire market share quarter after quarter. Now notwithstanding the robust growth in credit cards, personal loans is actually outpacing credit cards, and that has happened over the past 5 quarters in a row. And you will note that in the first quarter of 2024, personal loans grew by 25% on an FX-neutral basis. Credit card grew by 8%. 
 Now to your question, within personal loans, I would then refer you to -- let me take a look here to Slide 15, in which you can see the evolution of the originations of personal loans.  You will see that over the past 4 quarters, it increased from BRL 6 billion per quarter to more than BRL 12 billion. So we almost doubled the originations. You see that still, the primary driver of this absolute growth is with unsecured personal loans. The eligibility of which continues to expand across our customer base. 
 If you take a look at the total personal loan -- unsecured personal loan pie in Brazil, which accounts for the second or third largest profit pools in the country, our customers alone, as of the end of the fourth quarter, accounted for about 43% of the entire loan book in Brazil. And we still have no less than 8% market share there, so we have plenty of room to grow. 
 Now at the beginning of the second half of 2023, we expanded in secured personal loans, which encapsulates consignado or public payroll loans, FGTS and investment-backed loans. Public payroll loans and FGTS account for about 90% of our total originations, with investment-backed loans accounting for 10%. We expect that the originations of secured personal loans will continue to outpace the originations of unsecured personal loans as we increase the collateral agreements that we have as of today.
 So today, we offer public payroll loans, Jorge, primarily to INSS and SIAPE, which are now federal public servants and pensioners and retirees, which account broadly for 50% of the target market of secured personal loan in Brazil. We will be increasing our scope to add armed forces in many states and municipalities, and we hope to reach about 75% of the target market by the end of 2024. 
David Velez-Osomo: And just to finalize that, Jorge, I think one, perhaps, easy way to understand really the significant opportunity we continue to have ahead is we have more or less 60% of the Brazilian adult population as a customer. That 60% owns something like 40% to 50% of the entire credit pool in the country. And if you just look, on an average basis, across the lines, we probably have something like 10% market share.
 So we could double, triple, quadruple the size of our existing credit portfolio. And the bottleneck to growth is on the unsecured side, our own willingness to grow, our own willingness to take risk. And thus, in certain areas, we go very slowly, and we test our way into acceleration. And on the secured side, our bottleneck is signing up a bunch of contracts with a number of different entities. 
 We have been signing up all those contracts. Whenever we go to the entities and we say we are going to be offering products for your associates that are 30% to 40% lower interest than everybody else, that is a very good value proposition for them. And so we haven't seen a lot of real resistance in signing up the contracts with us. 
 There is some interconnection of systems. We have to integrate with a number of older systems, so that takes some time, and that's going to be taking some time over to next year. But so far, we feel very good about our ability to grow in the pool of addressable secured portfolio in the country. 
Jorge Kuri: If I may ask a follow-up. I'm looking at your Slide 19, where you have the last 5 quarters of gross profit margin. Given the particularities of what's happening with your asset mix and the deposit mix with Mexico, would it still be fair to assume a seasonal behavior like we see here in 2023, where, sequentially, every quarter was up in terms of gross profit margin in 2023? Would that be applicable for this year? Or the dynamics are going to be different because of these 2 items that I mentioned? 
Guilherme Marques do Lago: Jorge, I think it will largely depend on the velocity with which we grow deposits in both Mexico and Colombia, by and large.  If it was only for Brazil, one would expect that gross profit margins would continue to expand sequentially throughout the quarters, especially because the first quarter is usually a low seasonal quarter for us. 
 But the expansion of gross profit margins in Brazil is partially or fully offset by headwinds coming from Mexico and Colombia. So those 2 things will be playing out. It depends on the speed with which they play that we will see this resulting in our gross profit margin. I still believe that throughout 2024, one would expect to see gross profit margins for the full year very much in line with the gross profit margin that we had for the third quarter of 2023, so around 42%, 43%. 
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Eduardo Rosman from BTG Pactual. 
Eduardo Rosman: I have a question here. I want to delve deeper into your strategy of deposits in Mexico. You're having massive success, but that's naturally coming at a cost, right? So when we look to incumbents, we see that they pay very little, as a percentage of the reference rate. So what's the goal there in terms of remuneration, short and medium term? Goal is to reduce the remuneration? Or eventually pressure competition to move higher? And also, if you can also give an update as well on your recent partnership for cash-in and cash-out and the challenge naturally to grow deposits in the low income there. 
David Velez-Osomo: Eduardo, here's David. So listen, Mexico is a really attractive market for a number of different reasons. One of the interesting reasons that has become much more visible to us recently is that, differently from Brazil, the deposits as a product is the largest source of profit for the incumbent banks. So when you look at the average yield that banks are paying consumers, it's something like 3% to 4% a year when you have an interest rate -- a sovereign interest rate in the 12%, 13% plus. So this is a bit of an abnormality in a regular banking market, because banks are effectively making significant profits without really taking any risk. 
 When you look at Brazil, you see a market where -- that is driven very much by taking credit risk, which generally is what you would expect in competitive markets. That's not the case in Mexico. And when you look at the level of interest rates in products, they are still very high. So in a product when we make -- we look at our unit economics, even offering at very high yield, we're still making positive unit economics given the structure of the market. 
 Now given the fact of how these profits exist in the system, we think this is a really interesting disruption opportunity for the entire Mexican system, because if most of your profits are coming from deposits, frankly, the barrier to entry is not that high. Yes, probably in the past, you needed branches. Now you don't. And yes, brand is important because consumers won't leave their life savings in a brand that they don't trust. But the reality is if you have a good brand and you have a very good product, you will take those deposits away.
 And, I think, the past 6 to 9 months and the pace of growth that we're showing with this yield is showing very significant growth above our expectations and much higher than our fintechs that are paying even higher yields than we are. So we're, not only necessarily just competing by higher yields. You are already being able to see that we built a very solid and trusted brand in Mexico and this has been a big source of deposits.
 Now all being said, I think in the long term, we will also rationalize the cost that we are expecting. We tend to make this decision based on value proposition. Our goal is to have the very best deposit value proposition in the country. That is a function of yield and features. Initially, our features were not that big, which meant we had to rely a lot on yield, and that's what we're doing right now. But very soon, our features have been growing. And by the end of the year, it will be a very different product.
 And you mentioned cash-in, cash-out, that was a significant bottleneck that we had a few months ago. We are solving that as we speak. So as we increase the level of features, as we increase the value proposition, as we strengthen the brand, we expect to be able to decrease yield while maintaining the best value proposition. We think that incumbent banks are going to have to increase the yield that they're offering consumers if they want to keep a lot of these consumers.
 Ultimately, in this new world, there's just not that many barriers of entry and you just cannot keep your consumers trapped. They will go to whoever gives them the best option. And so we think we are on path to building that product in that category that way. 
Guilherme Marques do Lago: Rosman, if I may add one thing. What we have been seeing in Mexico, as we have seen in Brazil in the past, is that as we attract deposits from customers in the country, we are also benefiting from very relevant second order impacts that allows us to increase our brand awareness. It allows us to increase credit card applications. Our credit card applications have more than doubled in Mexico since we repriced our deposit products. It allows us to acquire data to do better credit underwriting and customer segmentation. It gives us positive credit selection.
 So there is a tremendous amount of second order impact that the deposit flows are bringing to our flywheel that are not necessarily captured, only in the absolute nominal amounts of deposits that we see coming in. 
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from Yuri Fernandes at JPMorgan. 
Yuri Fernandes: I have just one on renegotiated loans. I see you don't have the slide anymore on your presentation. So if you may just provide some color on how the numbers are tracking in the first quarter, how this compares to the 9.6% that you had in the 4Q? So just trying to get some color on renegotiated loan strength. 
Guilherme Marques do Lago: Yuri, this is Lago. Thanks for the question. So renegotiations loans still account for about 10% of our portfolio. It has not changed materially since we last presented this. We do expect that we will be disclosing our renegotiation rates on an annual basis at the -- whenever we disclose our fourth quarter results. In addition to that, you can see some levels of renegotiations in the filings that we present to the local regulators, especially in Brazil that we do on a 6-month basis.
 Going forward, however, as we know, change and reposition, the mix of our credit products in Brazil primarily, both between personal loans and credit; cards and within personal loans, between secured and unsecured, those should directly affect the rates of negotiations. But there has been no material change since we last presented this in the last quarter. 
Yuri Fernandes: Super clear, Lago. And just for a better understanding on new NPL formation and asset quality trends, you mentioned renegotiations are not there. Is there any other factor that is helping your new NPL formation? Or is this really a mostly stable quarter for new NPL formation for the company? 
Guilherme Marques do Lago: So, I think, there's no material nonrecurring item that would be distorting our NPL and Stage 3 formation. So, I think, they are pretty much BAU. 
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Pedro Leduc of Itaú. 
Pedro Leduc: I'm looking at NII post cost of risk and it rose mid-single digits Q-on-Q, if I'm not wrong. I understand your provisions ate up a lot of the NII growth. I'm really curious about this combo, this net basis of mid-single-digit growth. It's historically below what you've been growing at and I don't see that much of a difference in your loan book growth. 
 So -- I have some hypothesis, maybe the loan book that we see at the end of the quarter doesn't reflect the average of what it was last quarter, so it didn't generate that much NII or that incurred losses are being different than the expected loss that you had to catch up. Really curious on how you piece together this NII post cost of risk being basically flat and how we should think about it going forward. 
Youssef Lahrech: Pedro, this is Youssef. Thanks for the question. So I think you're referring to risk-adjusted NIM on Page 26, where you can see the evolution over time. And again, as a reminder, if you compare quarter-on-quarter, you have to bear in mind that Q4 2023 was impacted by a suppression of the CLA because of higher recoveries than normal and that was driven by Desenrola and some of the collections programs we put in place in Brazil to take advantage of that as well. 
 So in reality, the 10.2% in Q4 was inflated. It would have been closer to what we've experienced this quarter at 9.5%. So -- and in reality, if you take a longer-term horizon view year-on-year,  we've seen a pretty sizable expansion of the risk-adjusted NIM by about 320 basis points or so. If you look at cost-of-risk around -- along the same basis, it went from 8.7% to 10%, so about 130 basis points. So you see quite a bit more expansion in the margin, 2.5x expansion in the margin compared to the expansion in cost of risk. 
Guilherme Marques do Lago: Pedro, the only thing I would add to what Youssef mentioned, if I may, is that if you take a look at the originations of -- and the mix of new credits that we have added in the first quarter of 2024, I would draw your attention to Page #15. You will see that unsecured personal loans in the fourth quarter of 2023 grew by about BRL 400 million. And it grew by about BRL 1.6 billion from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024. So there was a material growth in credit books in unsecured personal loans, which actually draw more CLA than credit cards. So the mix of growth also plays a role on how risk-adjusted net interest margins should be seen. But I'm not sure if we have fully addressed your question, Pedro. 
Pedro Leduc: Yes. I'm almost a little more confused, because I thought 4Q, you had a netting [ effect ] and  provisions. I thought it was net zero if I was comparing it sequentially. And I do understand your reasoning there on the mix evolution. But as I did expect it to come a little bit more with NII, expecting it originated more towards the end of the quarter. 
Guilherme Marques do Lago: No. I mean, we can certainly follow up with you in more details on the timing of the originations throughout the quarter. But I don't think there was any one-off originations that happened, let's say, in March that was materially higher than what happened in January and February, so relatively levels of originations. 
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Mario Pierry from Bank of America. 
Mario Pierry: I wanted to stay on asset quality. When we look at your NPLs, they are at the highest level in the series, right? The NPL over 90 days is 6.3%. When I look at your loan Stage 3 formation at 3.7%, also historical high. You talked about, on your release, that the increase in expected losses -- or you had an increase in the expected losses because you're increasing the risk profile of the newer cohorts.
 So what we're seeing in Nubank is very different than what we're seeing at the other banks in the system in Brazil, where the banks really became very cautious in lending and we're seeing our NPLs improving and asset quality improving. 
 So I wanted to pick your brain as how can you be so confident, right, in continuing to take on more risk? Why do you think that the consumer in Brazil is in good shape. You already showed, right, that the interest portion of the credit card is at 26%, well above the industry. 
 And so the ability of the consumer to continue to take on more credit and more risk, clearly, right, you are pricing that. You're increasing your return on your loans, but eventually, it gets to a level that is too high. So just trying to pick your brain here. It seems like you're moving down into a riskier segment of the population, while everyone else is doing the opposite. So that's my question. 
Youssef Lahrech: Yes. Youssef, here. Thanks so much for the question. So let me maybe address or remind us a little bit about how we think about credit underwriting, if you'll allow me, and then I'll address specifically the latest trends. So when we underwrite credit, our objective is not to minimize NPLs. 
 Rather, our objective is to maximize the NPV of that credit brand to maximize the NPV of that customer relationship subject to resilience constraints, right? So specifically, we want to ensure that every credit grant that we make is NPV positive, even in the event of a downturn. So we typically don't take a position with respect to timing, the point of the cycle at which we're at. We're fairly agnostic to that. 
 We want every origination we make to perform in good and bad times. So when we see opportunities to expand credit and taking a little bit more risk, especially with products and features that customers love and create a lot of value. For them, like, we see with some of the financing products we've introduced, like fixed financing on the credit card or unsecured loans, we're not shy about taking that risk, but we always do it with very rigorous testing. 
 Sometimes testing for months and several quarters before we roll out and very rigorous monitoring of the risk and return that we get as a result. And we've been very happy with the results of those expansions, as I mentioned earlier, be they in personal loans, secured and unsecured or in credit cards, as you can see in the expansion of our interesting-earning portfolio that Lago talked about. 
 One way perhaps to think about the dynamic of -- the dynamic in our credit book is looking at the data we showed on Page 25 of the earnings presentation, which shows you NPLs as a ratio of interest-earning balances. You see there that we've grown interest-earning portfolio balances faster than we've grown NPLs. And thus, that's a simple way to kind of validate that this is accretive to return in NPV.
 So again, this is not a result of us kind of taking a particular position on where we are at the cycle. It's rather us testing over months and quarters and years, new products, new features, observing the returns and then deciding to roll out when we see really good and resilient returns on that. 
David Velez-Osomo: One point I would add, just to close on Youssef's explanation is the majority of the additional products, the financing products that we've been launching, that we've been growing are very short-term duration in nature. We're talking about 30, 60 days type of loans. 
 So this tends to be a really high information-rich type of product that allows us to react very quickly to any signs that we might see, things that are not playing out as we expect. Again, we're making an underwriting decision based on our view of an NPV model, based on a lot of testing, based a lot of foundational testing that we're doing. And the ability to do this type of short-term -- short-duration products just allow us to increase the financing portfolio that we have while maintaining significant control on the risk of the portfolio. 
Mario Pierry: Okay. Let me ask a follow-up here. When I look at your credit cards outstanding in Brazil, it went up by about 200,000 from $37.5 million to $37.7 million. Even though your active clients in Brazil grew by 3.6 million. So this is the slowest pace in the increase of number of cards, right? 
 The average -- you're growing about 1.8 million credit cards in Brazil in 2023 per quarter. Now you did 200,000. What does this mean? Does it mean, like, you are being more conservative? Or you reached a percentage of your client base that it's -- they don't have the capacity to take on a new credit card? 
Guilherme Marques do Lago: Mario, one thing that I would point out, and I'd certainly let my other colleagues chime in is that, in Brazil, as we start to approach now 55%, 60%, 65% of the adult population, it's inevitable that the marginal growth will not necessarily come from adding more customers or more credit cards to the existing customer base. 
 We still have a lot to go there, but it's only natural that at some point in time, the growth in number of customers of the number of cards will diminish. But what we still have plenty of room ahead is what you can see on Page 34 of the earnings presentation. And you can see the evolution of the purchase volume and the evolution of ARPAC as the customers mature. 
 So even at the customers that we have on-boarded 24 months ago, they are tripling their purchase volume as they mature their usage with us. So what we will naturally see in Brazil is that a natural kind of a flattening of the curve of number of customers and credit card customers, but the continuous evolution of the maturation of purchase volumes in ARPAC. 
 And then conversely, Mexico and Colombia are in the very early days of the expansion of a number of customers and number of cards. So they are in a different point of the escrow cycle there. 
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Flores of Citi. 
Brian Flores: I wanted to make a follow-up on Mexico. We talked on the liability side, and, I think, that is ramping up very well. Wanted to ask you on the asset side, right? Because we have seen, as Lago mentioned, some room for optimization with the low LDR so far. So I wanted to pick your brain on what key differences have you found in client behavior, infrastructure? And also, how has your strategy affected this, right? And if you think the speed is going according to the plan? Or do you think it's maybe a bit slower? Or a bit ahead? 
David Velez-Osomo: Thanks for the question. So we've said a lot of times in the past that we tend to go into a new market, underwriting very conservative, a very conservative approach. And the growth curve that you will see from us in a lot of the unsecured products really now is periods of acceleration, periods of pause, even periods of tactical detractions, accelerations, pauses. You saw that if you look at our growth rate in unsecured lending and personal loans maybe 12 to 8 months ago. We had a bit of a pause and we accelerated again. I think Mexico is following a very similar path. We launched slowly, we accelerated. We did a lot of foundational testing.
 That's, by the way, the reason why delinquency in the country was much higher. We were just testing a lot. This really means giving a number of different lines and credit cards to consumers where we don't have really any data. A lot of these is credit losses. But in reality, it's CapEx. It's effectively R&D dollars into building our own models. 
 And where you've seen Mexico, maybe over the past 6 months, was after a period of acceleration with deaccelerated growth. We went into a period of slowing down a bit our growth, partly was to continue working on new generations of models that ingested new data sources, partly was also because we wanted to see how funding was going to come on. 
 As you, obviously know, we cannot just accelerate too much if we don't have funding resolved. So getting NuConta right in Mexico for us was the number one strategic imperative, because if we don't have that part of the balance sheet, we don't really have a business. 
 So with the decelerated a bit to continue iterating on products. We launched NuConta. NuConta has been very successful. We've also -- if you look at some of the numbers that we  disclosed, the regulatory reports or delinquency in Mexico has been coming down a lot very fast. We're operating with much lower delinquency levels. 
 And this is now driving a low acceleration, again, into credit cards in Mexico and new accounts. You see that, also, the number of new customers in Mexico has accelerated over the last quarter. So I'll give you all this context to effectively say we're now on path of accelerating again on Mexico. We have the funding.
 We're very comfortable with some of the data sources, our ability to do underwriting based on our own methodology, on our own consumer behavior. And we'll continue to operate a bit like that. As we see opportunities, we accelerate. We see things that worry us a bit, we pause a bit. And that tends to be the path that we tend to take in these new markets. 
Guilherme Marques do Lago: The only thing, Brian, I would add is that if you take a look at the first quarter results of our operations in Mexico, the one that we filed with the local regulators, you will note that we're already growing our book in Mexico at about 7%, 8% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We expect this growth rate, as David mentioned, will pick up in the coming quarters. 
Brian Flores: Perfect. And if I may follow up just very quickly, do you have any updates on the banking license? Do you think this is critical to really ramp up growth as you mentioned? 
David Velez-Osomo: Yes, sure. So it is not critical to ramp up growth. We can continue ramping growth with the SOFIPO license that we have. We are getting the deposits that we need, and that's the critical part. I think the banking license is really critical for the long term of Mexico. There are certain bottlenecks in the SOFIPO license that eventually will become real issues for our products. One specific example is deposit insurance. SOFIPO only gives us a deposit insurance of something like $18,000 to $19,000 and bank license gives deposit insurance all the way to $180,000.
 So for Mexican high income consumers, it will be critical to have a banking license. That's not our core target today. It also -- a banking license will also expand the possibilities of cash-in, cash-out with certain banking correspondents. And so thinking ahead of where the business will be in 5 years from now, we definitely need the banking license. And that's why we already, last year, entered with the process of the banking license. The process is going well with -- I think the regulators are doing all of their work around the due diligence. 
 We've been very active working the regulator, answering all the questions that they've received. And so far, it's going according to expectations. It's not necessarily an easy process. It's not a fast process, but we're taking the process very seriously. And so far, we've heard very goodwill from the regulator in enabling new players to get banking licenses to bring much more competition into the banking space in Mexico. 
Jorg Friedemann: And our final question comes from Neha Agarwala from HSBC. 
Neha Agarwala: I wanted to zoom in on Mario's previous question in terms of asset quality. Originations, especially in the personal loans, was extremely strong this quarter, but early delinquencies have inched up. I understand part of that is seasonality. But given the rate outlook and the softening of economic activity, would you be more concerned or more cautious in the coming quarters and try to step back a bit in terms of originations? Or should we see continued these level of originations for personal loans? Or an acceleration? 
Youssef Lahrech: Neha, this is Youssef. Thanks so much for the question. So you are right in pointing out that the NPL movement in the quarter from Q4 to Q1, particularly NPL 15 to 90, was largely the result of seasonality that we've experienced, so 90 bps increase typically. The increase in Q4 to Q1 is 80 bps, so more or less within the seasonal expectations and perhaps to be super precise a little bit, coming from credit expansion, as we mentioned multiple times in both personal loans and secured personal loans and the credit card earning interest portfolio as well.
 And as I mentioned before, we tend to be fairly agnostic to the point in the cycle at which we're at because when we originate credit, when we underwrite credit, we always make sure that, that credit performs and is NPV positive under good times and bad times, right? So we stress the risk expectations in our NPV model, which ensures that our cohorts, on aggregate, can withstand a doubling of risk and still be NPV positive. So we're very comfortable with the level of resilience with which we operate that way. 
 With that all said, as I've mentioned in past quarters and this quarter again, our expectation is that there are going to continue to be really good opportunities for us to expand our credit portfolio across the board, right? We see updates to expand in secured lending as Lago and David have discussed. We see opportunities in unsecured personal loans to increase eligibility to -- of customers and also in credit cards with the continued growth of IEPs and the continued rollout of new products and features on the financing front.
 So our expectation is definitely that there will continue to be opportunities to extend. And typically, as we've done in the past, in Brazil and Mexico and other markets, when we see results that are a little bit different than what we expect on the downside, we will take the appropriate action to slow down if that's what the situation calls for.

David Velez: Thank you Jorg. Good evening, everyone and thank you again for being with us today. During Q2 2024 our business model anchored in three fundamental principles, customer expansion, revenue per customer and efficient operating costs, demonstrated its formidable strength by accelerating earnings power. Our net customer additions have consistently exceeded expectations reaching 105 million customers by the end of the quarter, a 60% increase from the 65 million recorded just two years ago. Customer growth in Brazil remains outstanding with an average of 1.2 million new customers monthly bringing the total to 95.5 million at the end of the quarter. Meanwhile, Mexico also experienced strong growth with 1.2 million net ads in the quarter culminating in 7.8 million customers. This success validates our strategy of increasing deposit yields in Mexico, boosting our momentum and solidifying Nu as the leading digital financial platform in Mexico. Additionally, Colombia surpassed the 1 million customer mark ending the quarter with almost 1.3 million customers following the successful launch of the Cuenta product. Now let's go to some financial highlights. Despite Latin currencies depreciating against the U.S. dollar during the quarter, our revenue surged to $2.8 billion as we continued to successfully cross-sell and upsell while introducing relevant new products, reflecting a 65% year-over-year increase. Our gross profit climbed to $1.4 billion marking an 88% year-over-year growth with a gross margin of 47.7%. Net income also saw significant growth reaching $487 million resulting in a record annualized return of equity of 28%, one of the highest in the industry. Additionally, our adjusted net income hit $563 million with a sequential expansion of 36% quarter-over-quarter and 131% year-over-year. These achievements underscore the strength of our business model which combines robust top-line growth with solid profitability. In this Slide, we again demonstrate how our flywheel effectively drives customer acquisition and data growth while sustaining strong momentum in our key financial metrics. Our model's inner and operational strengths are driving significant profitability. In the second quarter, Nu Holdings achieved an adjusted net income of 563 million with an adjusted annualized return on equity of 33% despite maintaining a robust level of excess capital of $2.4 billion at the holding level and with two subsidiaries in Mexico and Colombia yet to be profitable. Now, I'd like to pass the floor to our CFO, Guilherme Lago, who will guide you through our financial numbers. Over to you, Lago.
Guilherme Lago: Thank you, David, and good evening, everyone. As David mentioned, we delivered a robust second quarter as we continue to increase revenue growth, see enhanced customer engagement, and deliver strong operating margins and profitability. Now, let's dig deeper into the second quarter results to gain a greater understanding of the progress against each one of these pillars. I will begin with the results of our customer acquisition. During the second quarter of 2024, our customer base grew at a strong pace with 5.2 million new customers joining our platform. By the end of the quarter, our total customer count reached 104.5 million, marking a 25% increase year-over-year. Once we add more customers, engaging and retaining them becomes our focus. Our active base increased by 27% year-over-year, followed by another sequential quarterly increase in the monthly activity rate, which now stands at 83.4%, up from 82.2% just one year ago. This marks the 11th consecutive increase in this metric, demonstrating our proficiency and consistently offer of compelling value proposition to our customers in Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia. Turning our attention to revenue expansion. The first chart highlights the Nu has established primary banking relationships with around 60% of our active customer base. This solid performance underscores our ability to increase the share of wallet in an agile manner within our customer base. Moreover, recent cohorts are achieving this level of principality at an increasingly rapid pace. As you can see in the second chart, the number of products per active customer is at 4.1, illustrating the success of our cross-selling strategy, even as we continue to quickly onboard many new customers. By effectively introducing our products to new customers, we solidify our role as their primary banking partner. The last chart illustrates the combined effect of these two powerful dynamics. By having significant customer engagement, as demonstrated in the first chart, coupled with our growing product cross-sell capabilities, shown in the second chart, we achieved increasingly positive results. While our monthly ARPAC contracted to $11.2 this quarter, compared to $11.4 last quarter, on an FX-neutral basis, ARPAC in fact expanded by 6%. On the next Slide, we will present the growth rates on an FX-neutral basis, and you can also note that our more mature cohorts are already generating a monthly ARPAC of $25. Our monthly ARPAC reached $11.2. However, on an FX-neutral basis, it grew 6% sequentially and a robust 30% year-over-year, up from $9.3 just one year ago. We continue to see a clear path to further increase ARPAC towards its full potential. The second chart highlights that our revenues hit a new record high this quarter, reaching $2.8 billion, an increase of 65% year-over-year. Just a year ago, our revenues stood at $1.8 billion. This impressive growth was driven by two things, the increase in active customers, combined with higher ARPAC levels year-over-year. This quarter, our consumer finance portfolio, encompassing credit cards and lending, showed a strong growth. While the nominal dollar value of our book contracted, it achieved a 49% year-over-year and an 8% quarter-over-quarter expansion on an FX-neutral basis, reaching a total of $18.9 billion. This growth was driven by increases across both product categories. Credit cards expanded sequentially. Despite the same FX impact in nominal dollars, it grew by 39% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter, reaching $14.3 billion. This growth was driven by the consistent increase in the share of wallet across all customer segments. Once again, our lending portfolio performed extremely well, growing 92% year-over-year and 15% quarter-over-quarter on an FX-neutral basis, reaching $4.6 billion. Lending growth continues to outpace credit cards and now represents 24% of the total portfolio. Consistent with trends from the previous quarters, our lending cohorts continue to show strong credit performance, enabling us to scale originations effectively. Now, let's move to the breakdown of our credit card portfolio. Interest-earning installment balance now represents 28% of our total credit card portfolio, up from 26% last quarter. Once again, this growth was fueled by the successful expansion of our PIX and Boleto financing products. This type of financing offers an attractive risk-adjusted rate of return, enabling us to further expand the monetization of our credit card business while meeting important customer needs. Our strategy is further validated by the stability of our revolving receivables, which remain at 6% of total credit card receivables this quarter. Going forward, we expect the percentage relevance of interest-earning installments balance to begin to stabilize. Looking at our lending business, originations reached R$13 billion this quarter, a 78% year-over-year increase. Unsecured lending remains the primary driver of growth, reaching R$11.2 billion in originations this quarter. This highlights our ability to extend credit availability to those who previously lacked access to this product. Our secure lending originations reached R$1.8 billion during the second quarter of 2024, or 14% of total lending originations. During the second half of the year, we anticipate a gradual increase in the pace of originations of secure lending, as new features such as portability top-ups and refinancings are introduced. We have also signed six new collateral agreements to increase eligibility in TAM, including parts of the Armed Forces and some of the major Brazilian states and municipalities. The integrations of these new entities are ongoing, and once completed, we will release the product for newly eligible customers, thus helping us further grow originations. In fact, during the month of July 2024, total originations exceeded R$5.2 billion, of which 750 million in secure lending alone. Now let's review the progress on the funding front. Although deposits in our Brazilian business contracted in nominal dollars to 21.7 billion, they expanded 10% quarter-over-quarter on FX neutral terms. Our total deposit base for the quarter increased to $25.2 billion, representing a 64% year-over-year growth, primarily driven by significant expansion in Mexico through Cuenta Nu. By the end of the second quarter of 2024, we surpassed over $3 billion in deposits in Mexico, more than tripling in just two quarters. The strong growth in Mexico represents a significant milestone in building one of the strongest local currency retail deposits franchise in Latin America. Another noteworthy achievement was the launch of New Colombia's checking account product in the second quarter of 2024, which attracted over $220 million in consumer deposits, more than 80% in the month of June. Net interest income, or NII, increased by 77% year-over-year, reaching another record high of $1.7 billion. This consistent growth was driven by our expanding credit card and lending products, collectively boosting our NII and Net Interest Margins, or NIM, to new record highs. For the second quarter of 2024, we delivered a net interest margin of 19.8%, an increase of 30 basis points from last quarter and 150 basis points from one year ago. Looking ahead, and regardless of the directions of interest rates, we are confident that the primary driver for future NIMs will be the continuous deployment of our balance sheet capacity in the form of credit originations growth. Our excess deposits today, invested primarily in public bonds, yield much lower returns compared to the lowest yield loan products, such as secure credits. Let's now turn our attention to the very last pillar of our overall strategy, maintaining a low cost-to-serve. Our platform remains one of the most cost-effective in our markets, with its low cost-to-serve providing a significant competitive advantage. We anticipate this cost at or below the $1 per active customer for the foreseeable future. And once again, we successfully achieved this goal, with a cost-to-serve per active customer at 0.90. On an FX-neutral basis, this figure has grown 19% year-over-year when adjusted by one-offs related to network reimbursements in Mexico during the second quarter of 2023. In the same period, our ARPAC expanded by 30%. This showcases the strong operating leverage of our business model. Our gross profit reached a new quarterly high of approximately $1.4 billion, an 88% year-over-year increase. Our annualized gross margins has rebounded to 2023 levels, despite higher costs of funding in the new Geos. Our investments in Mexico and Colombia have been effectively offset by the positive trends in Brazil, driving our gross margins to 47.7%. A core element of our strategy is achieving operational leverage. Our efficiency ratio stood at 32% during the second quarter of 2024, an improvement of 10 basis points from the first quarter of 2024, and more than 300 basis points better than a year ago. We are set to fully harness our platform's operational potential as we expand our customer base, upsell and cross-sell products, launch new features, and achieve profitability in the new markets of Mexico and Colombia, which are essentially in their investment phases. Let's now review the sustainable advantages across all four cost pillars. Number one, our cost to acquire was stable at $7. This figure continues to be one of the lowest among consumer fintechs and banks globally. Number two, as expected, our cost to serve remains exceptionally low, below $1 and approximately 85% lower than those of incumbent banks. This position is Nu as one of the most efficient financial services companies worldwide. Number three, on cost of risk, we have effectively managed credit risk, consistently outperforming competitors on an apples-to-apples basis with respect to delinquency rates. And finally, number four, on the cost of funding, we have significantly increased deposits volumes while maintaining our cost of funding at a competitive level of 87% of the blended interbank rates of the countries in which we operate. This has closed the gaps with incumbent banks and widened our advantage over consumer fintechs. And finally, turning to net income, we deliver another quarter of strong profitability with net income reaching $487 million, representing an increase of 134% compared to the previous year. These results underscore the effectiveness of our strategy and business model. Additionally, adjusted net income for this quarter reached $563 million, growing 131% versus one year ago. While we are very encouraged by the second quarter results, our focus remains steadfast on long-term value creation. This approach may involve making strategic short-term investments to optimize our long-term opportunities. Now, I'd like to hand over the call to Youssef, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will walk you through the key highlights of our asset quality and credit portfolio health.
Youssef Lahrech: Thank you, Lago, and good evening, everyone. Let's start by having a look at our NPL trends. First, following an anticipated seasonal rise in NPL 15 to 90 in the first quarter of 2024, which is typical for early-stage delinquencies, it has decreased to 4.5% this quarter, slightly more than historical seasonality. Second, our 90-plus NPL ratio increased to 7%, also in line with expectations. The 70-basis point increase in 90-plus NPL this quarter is simply a reflection of the 90-basis point mostly seasonal increase in 15 to 90 NPL we saw last quarter. As discussed in past earnings calls, we are intentionally and strategically growing our lending book and expanding down the credit spectrum where we see relevant opportunities. In line with our credit philosophy, we prioritize decisions that optimize the long-term net present value of our credit cohorts, rather than focusing solely on short-term NPL metrics. When we identify asset classes or customer segments with compelling risk-adjusted returns that promote responsible customer behavior, we actually pursue growth in those areas. As we will show in the next few slides, this strategy has yielded increased revenue and greater resilience that are more than offsetting the higher delinquency rates that come with it. To illustrate the impact of credit expansion on our consumer finance portfolio, we are presenting this analysis of normalized NPLs starting in December 2022 before the latest waves of credit expansions. This shows what our NPLs would have been if we hadn't undertaken these expansions. In other words, you can see clearly that the increase in NPLs in the last several quarters is largely the product of these deliberate expansions. In fact, the evolution of these NPL metrics continues to closely follow our expectations. Similarly to last quarter, we show on this slide asset quality trends under a different basis, considering both 15 to 90 and 90 plus NPLs per interest earning balances rather than total receivables on the previous slides. On this basis, you can clearly see a stable to downward trend in the last few years, aside from the normal seasonal ups and downs like the ones we saw in Q1 with 15 to 90 and in Q2 with 90 plus. This goes to show that we have been remunerated for additional risk we've taken. In the next slide, we further validate this conclusion looking directly at risk-adjusted returns. To demonstrate the significant value generated by this expansion strategy, we show on this Slide the risk-adjusted margins, or RAMs, for our Brazil consumer credit portfolio with and without the risk expansions we undertook since late 2022. This clearly indicates that the additional revenues stemming from this expansion strategy have more than offset the additional credit risk and delivered substantially increased returns. Credit loss allowance expenses declined to $760 million this quarter, a decrease of only 2% on a 4x neutral basis. This slight drop is the result of two drivers. The first is the relatively slower growth base in Q2 compared to Q1, as growth is the main driver of our ECL provisions, as you can see in the appendix of this presentation. The second driver is early delinquency, which behaved slightly better than historical seasonality in the second quarter, as mentioned previously. Lastly, risk-adjusted NIM reached a record high of 11% this quarter, reflecting a 300-basis point expansion from a year ago and 150-basis point increase quarter over quarter. Now I would like to turn the call over to David. David, over to you.
David Velez: Over the past decade, we have cultivated unique attributes that position Nu to become the largest consumer technology platform in Latin America. These strengths include brand. By consistently simplifying complexity to empower people, we've built one of Brazil's most beloved and trusted brands, with recognition rapidly growing in Mexico and Colombia. Scale, with significant presence in Brazil, reaching now 56% of the adult population, enables us to offer superior products at lower prices, creating a powerful flywheel effect. Data. our vast data, supported by a cutting-edge infrastructure, forms the foundation of our advanced customer segmentation and credit underwriting capabilities. Talent. We boast one of the world's leading technology and product teams, a distinction unmatched by any other company in Latin America. Culture. Nu's values, including customer centricity and operational excellence, are deeply ingrained in every team member and driver of decision-making, ensuring our focus on long-term sustainable growth. While our success relies on a combination of these unique attributes, I'd like to double click on some key factors that place us in an unmatched market position. Our exceptional talent, our focus on technology as a driver of sustainable growth, and our enduring brand that has galvanized and empowered almost 105 million Latin Americans. Since our beginning, we have described ourselves as a technology company, not a financial institution. Therefore, through our 11 years of history, we have gone to great lengths to build what we think is the leading product engineering team in Latin America. Today, we have over 59 nationalities working at Nubank, and over 50% of our headcount is focused in technology and analytics. This access to world-class technical talent has been a key reason for our historical performance, and will continue to be a great enabler of overperformance over the long run as competition increases. Additionally, the ongoing AI revolution creates new opportunities for differentiation, and we're very focused on building on this talent magnet asset. As an example, I wanted to highlight our recently announced acquisition of Hyperplane. Hyperplane is a Silicon Valley-based leader in AI power solutions for the financial services space. As we tested Hyperplane's platform on our vast amount of data, we were impressed by the opportunity to meaningfully improve performance of even our most advanced machine learning models by using a financial services-focused foundation model that included our own unstructured data. We're very excited to welcome the Hyperplane team on board and see them as a key part of our AI strategy in the foreseeable future. The powerful trio of trust, exceptional service, and competitive pricing also underscore Nu's continuing success. This winning combination is the foundation of our beloved brand, attracting customers who seek the most compelling value proposition in the market. We believe that in a world of choices, customers will naturally gravitate towards those who offer superior products and services, and that's exactly what we provide. The growth of our deposit base in Mexico and now in Colombia is a testament to this principle. In Mexico, we've attracted $3.3 billion in retail deposits in just over a year since the launch of our checking account product. In Colombia, our Cuenta product, launched this quarter, has already garnered over $220 million in new deposits. While other players are pursuing even more aggressive pricing strategies, paying higher yields in their savings account, since launch, Nu has been able to capture over 70% of the deposits in both Mexico and Colombia across all fintechs combined. This proves that consumers are going beyond whoever simply pays them the highest yield and are coming to Nubank because of our product, our brand, and ultimately the entire user experience that we are providing. With that, we're now ready to address your questions. Thank you very much.
Operator: We will now start the Q&A session for investors and analysts. [Operator Instructions]. I would like to turn the call over to Jorg Friedemann, Investor Relations Officer.
Jorg Friedemann: Thank you, operator. And our first question comes from the line of Jorge Kuri, Morgan Stanley.
Jorge Kuri: Hi, everyone. Good afternoon and congrats on the results. Thanks for the caller on how originations are running in July. That's evidently an impressive number for the quarter already showing very strong run rate. Can you provide some color on how the payroll loan particularly is trending now that you have all of the features that consumers look for mainly the top up? What's the acceptance level that you're seeing with your consumers? What is the reaction from competitors? Are you taking share or is the growth coming from new customers? Just help us understand sort of like in these early days how this is shaping up. Thank you.
Guilherme Lago: Hi, Jorge. This is Lago. Thanks so much for the question. So we are super pleased with the performance of what we call our secure lending product, which encompasses both public payroll loans as well as FGTS. And we are still in the very early part of this journey, right? So today we are operating only with two collateral agreements, which are INSS and SIAPE. INSS for the pensioners and retirees and SIAPE for the Federal Public Servants. The two collateral agreements combined, they account for approximately 50% of the target market that we have in Brazil. We have already signed six additional collateral agreements with armed forces and some of the largest estates and municipalities in Brazil. And we expect to continue to expand this so that by the end of the year, our target market can be expanded from today's 50% to somewhere around 70% to 75%. And even more is expected to come in 2025. So that's one dimension of expansion. However, the second dimension of expansion is the launch of new products and features, which are still far from being complete. You did point out that we have already launched portability and we did so progressively throughout the second quarter of the year, but it's still with some features that are very important missing, specifically related to refinancing and top-up. And those two features, refinancing and top-up, when coupled with portability, can for the online or digital players account for more than 50% of their portability. So we are seeing kind of a progressive ramp up to the public payroll launch. We do believe that we have structural cost advantages to play in the segment. So as you know, we originate 100% digitally, therefore we have no customer acquisition costs whatsoever. We don't operate with loan brokers or branches. And our existing customers account for nearly 40% of the total public payroll on book in Brazil. So again, we don't need to fish outside of our fishbowl to tap into more than 40% of the total market. So early days for us, encouraging signs so far on both public payroll loans, and also if not primarily in FGTS, and we expect that growth will pick up in the coming quarters.
Jorg Friedemann: And the second question comes from the line of Pedro Leduc from Itaú.
Pedro Leduc: I would like to pick your brains a little bit on the provision expense side for bad credit here. We have seen that it increased a lot during 1Q, and back then we discussed how it was related for greater risk taking, well-planned, conscious move, and that had brought up those provision expenses. And now in the second quarter, this one affects neutral. You're sort of flat, lowering your cost of risk effectively. So I want to get your thoughts around this a little bit, probably go around how those recently originated portfolios have behaved, how we were seeing risk in the coming origination harvests, just to get a sense on the provision side. So that's that. Thank you again.
Youssef Lahrech: Hi, Pedro. This is Youssef. Thanks so much for the question. So look, I believe you're referring to Slide 24 of our presentation, which shows our CLA quarter-on-quarter. And you are correct that there was a slight contraction from Q1 to Q2 on an FX neutral basis, about 2% down. As I mentioned previously, you have to think about the fact that we provision when we grant loans or book credits on the basis of expected credit losses per IFRS 9. And so what's happened this quarter is the credit quality, the actual performance has played out per our expectations. In fact, even slightly better when you look at 15 to 90, as I pointed out. So that's what's in part driving the slight decrease in CLA, coupled with the fact that on a relative basis to the size of portfolio, the relative growth was less in Q2 than Q1. You know, another way to look at it is if you refer to the appendix of the presentation, I believe it's Slide 37 with the coverage ratios on both the basis of total loans and coverage of 90 plus, you see the coverage ratio of total loans has continued to go up, as one would intuitively expect, given that, you know, the net effect of all our growth is expanding credit and expanding credit risk. On the basis of 90 plus, it continues to be, you know, hovering around 200%. Again, the fact that it decreased a little bit is just based on the early delinquencies improving, as I mentioned.
Jorg Friedemann: And the next question comes from the line of Mario Pieri at Bank of America.
Mario Pierry: Let me stay on this topic of the provisions, because I think that was a big surprise this quarter. You show right on, I think it's Slide 11 or 12, that your originations went up. So you're originating more credit, and then you're provisioning less. Like you mentioned, you provision based on expected losses. So does it mean that you expect lower losses on these new originations than you had before? And why would that be the case because we continue to see, right, the NPLs going up. So, yes, that's my question. If you can give us a little bit more color on why even if originations going up, provisions are going down.
Youssef Lahrech: Yes, Mario, thanks for the question. Youssef again. So it might be helpful to refer to Slide 38 in the appendix of the presentation, which looks at the ECL itself, right? So you see ECL increased by about, 300 million or so. 400 million of that was growth. So like the impact of growth is fully reflected there. And then we had 110 million of other factors, mostly what I mentioned in terms of the slightly better than expected early delinquency performance. And so, in fact, we're continuing to grow this line item, the ECL line item. It's just a little bit better than our expectations when we front-loaded provisions in Q1.
Mario Pierry: Okay, and Youssef, you mentioned, right, that the NPLs continue to behave according to your expectations. But what are your expectations going forward for NPLs?
Youssef Lahrech: Yes, good question. So in terms of what to expect going forward, it's very much along the lines of continuing to grow our credit book. There's several dynamics at play. First of all, we continue to increase the relevance and the mix of lending, personal loans, both secured and unsecured, as a percentage of total receivables. Personal loans have been growing faster than credit cards. They tend to have on net a higher risk content. So that tends to push NPLs up and provisions up. But also within credit card, what we've been seeing over the last several quarters is a pickup in interest bearing receivables, because we have more interest bearing receivables in the credit card book that gives us better unique economics, which allows us to then expand credit to more customers and more credit to existing and already eligible customers. And then in both products, both personal loans and credit card, as we improve our models, as we get more data, more test results, we're able to serve more customers across the spectrum and expand our credit box. So all those dynamics point to, increasing NPLs and also increasing returns, as we've illustrated earlier in this call. There's one offsetting factor, which is the growth in secured lending, which tends to come with lower NPLs. But on net, I would expect to continue the trend that we've been seeing over the last several quarters. And again, this is all related to our philosophy of what are we trying to optimize when we grow, we try to optimize the NPV of that full customer relationship over its lifetime, including future cross-sell opportunities, including principality increases, et cetera., rather than trying to minimize NPLs over the short term. So again, when we see opportunities to grow in a way that's resilient, that is suitable for those customers, that is high NPS, high quality, we seize those opportunities. And so I, we still see a lot of opportunity to grow going forward on that basis. You can also just think of it through the lens of, in Brazil, for example, we have about 60% of total adult population. When you look at the proportion of customers who have Nubank as their primary banking account, it's about a third of the total population of Brazil. In contrast, our market share in our most mature product, like credit cards, is about 13%-14%. It's even lower when you look at loans, it's in the single digits, secured loans even lower in the small, in the small single digit range. And so we, we still see a lot of opportunity to grow those, those market shares on the basis of the customer base we already have.
Mario Pierry: Okay. So then to summarize, basically you're saying you expect NPLs to continue to go up. But we did see an acceleration in the deterioration this quarter, right? Like we saw 70 basis points deterioration, you were deteriorating 20 to 30 basis points before. Is that the 70 basis points that you were expecting? Or should we go back to the 20 to 30 basis points per quarter?
Youssef Lahrech: Right. So in terms of what we saw this quarter, the 70 basis points on 90 plus that you point out, the way I would think about it is if you go back one quarter and you look at what happened to 15 to 90, that was a seasonal pickup in Q1 of about 90 basis points. What we're observing this quarter in 90 plus is merely the impact of that rolling forward, into the next bucket of delinquency. So 90 basis points increase in 15 to 90 in Q1 resulted in about 70 basis points increase in Q2 in 90 plus. So that's just kind of the mechanics of it. And remember, Q1 tends to be the peak of delinquency in 15 to 90, which then translates to a peak increase in the next quarter in 90 plus. So I think that's just more than anything seasonality.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Geoff Elliot of Autonomous.
Geoff Elliott: We've spoken in the past about moving up market initiatives like Ultravioleta. But the message here feels almost one of moving down market, taking on more risk. If you look at the purchase volumes analysis by cohort that you show, it seems to point to maybe lower purchase volumes for newer customers. So what is the thinking on the shift up market? Is that still going to come? Is that pushback? What's happening there?
Guilherme Lago: So, Geoff, I think I'll try to chime in. I'll let my comments, my colleagues add as well. But Nu by no means, the growth that we have had in lending and credit cards suggests this deviation from our intention to grow very fast in high income. On the opposite, I think the high-income market provides us with a tremendous opportunity in consumer credit in Brazil as it accounts for a fairly relevant share of all of the asset classes in which we play. I think over the past now 12 to 24 months, we believe that we have made fairly good enrolls into our pursuit of increasing our share of wallet within the high-income population. As we pointed out in prior calls, we have the opportunity now to increase share of wallet largely as a result of our success in having acquired high income customers over the past two years. Today, if you define high income as a customer in Brazil who earns more than R$12,000, we estimate that we already have more than 60% of those high-income customers with us. Over the past quarters, we have materially improved brand awareness, materially improved brand considerations for the high-income segment. As of December 2023, we have become the number one player in NPLs within the high-income category. And high-income has become the fastest growing segment within our purchase volume. So, as a reference, the PV of Ultraviolet, which is our higher tier, has increased by over 70% over the past 12 months, even coming still from a relatively low base. But we are fairly encouraged on our drive to go into the high income. And we think that is fairly compatible and addictive to what we are doing in my opinion.
Geoff Elliott: Thanks. And the principality among high income, what would that look like?
Guilherme Lago: So, our overall principality is about 60%. I don't have the figures for high income, middle income and low income here, nor do I think we disclose them, but they are certainly higher within the bottom of the pyramid than they are within the top of the pyramid. The opportunity that we have now as we improved kind of our brand attributes, as we launch new products and features is to gain principality and share of wallets within the high-income customers. And as we track the primary banking relationship or PBR has increased quarter-after-quarter within the high-income segments in Brazil.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Yuri Fernandez, JPMorgan.
Yuri Fernandez: Congrats everybody for the quarter. I have a question. I think it was Lago mentioned in the beginning of the call that he expects interesting assets from the cards, the installments to start to stabilize. So, I want to confirm I heard this correctly. And if that's correct, why? Because you continue to make, good returns on fixed financing, boletos and credit cards, as you always mentioned, like this is a good risk adjusted product. So, basically confirming that we should see some stabilization on that ER for credit cards. And if yes, why should we see this stabilization? Thank you, guys.
Guilherme Lago: So, Yuri, thanks for the question. And I think you were referring to my remarks to Slide number 10, in which we see the evolution of our interest earning assets evolving from 19% last year to about 28% this year. So, it is first extremely hard to draw high conviction outlooks for innovative products. So, this is an innovation that we like to believe that we helped to introduce in Brazil. And you're absolutely right that we are very pleased with the unit economics of this product, with the customer adoption. We just feel that the adoption curve that we have experienced over the past four quarters has been fairly steep. So, it's hard for us to believe that we will continue to see the same adoption velocity over the coming quarters. So, we are assuming that going forward, there's going to be a slight reduction in the growth, not a reduction in the overall percentage, but probably not going to grow at the same pace as it grew in the prior quarters.
Yuri Fernandez: No, super clear. So, should still gain some penetration, but not maybe at the same pace as we are seeing currently, right? Basically, this is what it's trying to say.
Guilherme Lago: That's right.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Tito Labarta from Goldman Sachs.
Tito Labarta: A bit of a follow-up on asset quality, looking here at Slide 21 in the presentation, it does look like here that without the expansions, the early NPLs will be doing even better. So, just maybe help us think about the credit quality outlook that you see in Brazil versus ex-Brazil, where it's still very early stages and maybe you're taking on more risk there. Are you feeling more comfortable? I mean, you kind of alluded to this, but that maybe the Brazil credit quality outlook is getting better. And can that help you maybe even accelerate growth in Brazil a bit?
Youssef Lahrech: Tito, thanks for the question. So, as a reminder, thinking about macro and credit outlook, we try to refrain from making any bets on what's going to happen to macro on a going forward basis. In fact, if you look at our history, starting in Brazil, it is marked by big periods of instability, downturns, et cetera. And so, we feel like our philosophy continues to be one of demanding a lot of resilience from whatever growth we underwrite. So, we always kind of take the stance that the future will be worse than the past. And whatever we underwrite needs to be able to withstand a significant amount of deterioration. So, typically, our cohorts, as we've said in the past, will withstand a doubling of risk and still be above hurdle. And so, we continue to operate in this way where we tend to be fairly agnostic to any forecasts about the future. To your point, what we've seen when you back out the expansions and you look at what NPLs would have been without the expansions, we see a period of relative stability over the last year and a half or so. But we're not banking on that or any improvement going forward to be able to continue to grow.
Tito Labarta: Okay. No, that's fair. Thanks, Yusuf, for that. And maybe a follow-up. The risk-adjusted NIM, Slide 24, nice improvement there. As you continue to grow the loan book and monetize, do you think there's still room for that to continue to increase further?
Youssef Lahrech: Yes, it's a good question. So, as I mentioned earlier, we see continued opportunities to grow. As I described, the various categories of growth that are available to us across our personal loan and credit card products. That said, it's not a trend that I would expect to go on forever, right? Because we optimize NPV, as I said, over the lifetime of the customer relationship rather than minimizing NPL. But we are constraining that based on resilience, based on churn, based on quality of the product and the relationship in NPS. And so, those are all important guardrails and governance of how much we allow ourselves to grow down the credit spectrum. I think in the near term, we still see some opportunity, but I don't think these numbers are unbounded by any stretch of the imagination.
Tito Labarta: Yes, perfect. Thanks, Youssef.
Guilherme Lago: The one thing that I would add to what Youssef mentioned is that I would also point out that we have a gigantic opportunity to continue to optimize our balance sheet, right? So, our loan-to-deposit ratio is still below 40%, whereas most of the retail banks in the regions are above 100 percent. So, as we increase loan-to-deposit ratios, our net interest margins are expected to continue to expand. That will just be an additional tailwind to this trend that Yusuf was alluding to.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Eduardo Rosman at BTG Pactual.
Eduardo Rosman: I have a question regarding open banking. We have been seeing some important changes recently, right, such as the removal of the requirement for clients to grant access for a limited period. As far as I understand as well, we've been seeing also important discussions about the granularity of the data that needs to be shared, whether Nu needs to keep requesting the data or if the other bank, let's say, must provide information whenever something important to that client occurs. We also have been seeing some new articles talking about potential discussions to eliminate the reimbursement costs in case of portability. I think that this has been an issue for you on payroll. So, a lot of things happening and important discussions. So, it would be great if you guys could give us an update and let us know if these changes could be material for Nu. Thanks.
Guilherme Lago: Hi, Rosman. Thanks so much for your question. Look, open banking is probably one of the regulatory developments with which we are most excited in Brazil. If you step back for a moment and if you look at the regulatory framework of open banking that has been adopted in the country, it is probably one of the most progressive open banking frameworks that we have seen globally. Even if you compare this with the frameworks that have been developed in India or in the UK, it has a tremendous opportunity to lower the barriers for the exchange of information, to lower the attrition for the movement of data and to lower the attrition for the movements of both assets and liabilities. So, it is something that we have been investing quite a lot of time and energy and we are very excited with the prospects. Going a little bit more into the details. So, there has been a lot of efforts from many players to first gain constants from consumers to gain access to their data over the past years. We are happy to say that we probably have a market share that approaches one-third of all the constants in Brazil. We ended the second quarter of 2024 with about 50 million constants and that basically translates into additional data that feeds into our customer segmentation, credit underwriting models and translates into better products and features that we can offer to our consumers. Going forward, there is a lot to change in the next 6 to 8 months and we think that given the guidelines that have now been indicated by the Brazilian Central Bank, you will see lower barriers to exchange assets. So, credit assets, both unsecured and secure, to also exchange liabilities, i.e. deposits and funds and also insurance and capital markets. So, this can be really transformational to the Brazilian banking sector. We are monitoring this very hard and we are very glad with the cooperation that the Brazilian Central Bank has been fostering among the industry.
David Velez: Rosman, David here, I would just add that the agenda is very ambitious in open finance, as I was mentioning. The regulators' commitment is very, very focused in making it work, but the agenda has been so ambitious that the execution in the industry has been a bit challenging. So, there's been a couple of phases that have been harder for a lot of players to really integrate. So, there's been a couple of bumps in the road, I think, in terms of the timeline and how it's been executed. Now, I think conceptually, the will that we see from regulators is that it's going to happen, it's going to work out and it's so clearly good for the consumer to be able to have access to that data and have and increase the competition in financial services that ultimately consumers, society, government and regulators are very much aligned in making it work. So, while it's been a bit of a bumpy road or bumpier, I think, than people expected, that there is very clear line of sight into creating pretty significant changes in the Brazilian market.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Thiago Batista at UBS.
Thiago Batista: I have one question about, Nu do not have a banking license in Brazil. Do you believe it would make sense to ask for a bank license? And what would be the main positives and negatives of being a bank in Brazil right now? And finally, do you see any material change if central banks started to consider Nu as S1 and not S3 as it is today?
Guilherme Lago: Thiago, hi, this is Lago. Those are great questions. So, today, we don't see a need to acquire or apply for a banking license in Brazil. Our financial institution license called Financera, a couple with our payment institution license, basically allows us to offer every single thing that we believe is necessary to provide a fairly compelling offer to consumers, both individuals and SMEs. So, i.e., we can take deposits, we can issue credit cards, we can extend loans. Over time, it may be natural that we will try to simplify and consolidate our legal structure in Brazil and we may eventually apply or get a banking license at some point in time as the simplification of all of the legal entities that we have. What would be the implications if we were to do that in terms of no regulatory capital, in terms of no reporting requirements? The answer is zero in terms of regulatory capital and very little in terms of additional disclosure requirements. So, we don't see any material change if and when we were to pursue this path in Brazil. Your second question is, we are an S3 financial institution in the country. We think it is very likely that we will become an S2 financial institution in the country, most likely by mid-2025. Again, what are the implications to that from a regulatory capital perspective? It's zero, no implication whatsoever. We may have to do certain additional reports, analysis and disclosure requirements that may increase marginally our compliance cost, but those are completely immaterial given our overall regulation. Now, more importantly than the name of the license or if it is an S1, S2 or S3, we would like to believe that we have been able to collaborate very effectively and efficiently with the Brazilian Central Bank and try to know jointly with them, address any challenges, opportunities and concerns that our growth may generate in the countries where we operate.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Flores at Citigroup.
Brian Flores: Just wanted to ask a bit on Mexico. The information we saw from your information in the second quarter maybe showed a decrease in the loans to deposit ratio. Just wanted to pick up your brains and see how things are evolving there. You mentioned 3.3 billion in deposits, which is impressive. How is the credit part of that deployment going? Any news from the regulator? Any more color on Mexico would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
David Velez: Sure. Thank you for the question. So, we're very excited with what we're seeing in Mexico. The deposits number that you mentioned really surpassed any expectations. I think that made us kind of realize that there is a significant opportunity to really challenge the conventional wisdom in the Mexico market about how consumers see banks and their savings. The average cost of funding in banks in Mexico is something like 30% of the risk-free rate. The majority of consumers are not paid any yield whatsoever. And so, the moment that we went to market with a very competitive yield, it began changing behavior. And once you change that behavior and you change that idea in consumers' behaviors, we think it's very hard to go back. So, we like to see the beginning here of an environment where consumers are going to be expecting to get higher remuneration for their deposits. The 3.3 billion in deposits is way more than we need. And so, as we've done in Brazil over, the next forever, really, there's going to be an optimization of the balance sheet in how we allocate those deposits, but also the yield that we pay. And the other good news in Mexico really for us has been we continue to see very good environment in terms of credit quality and opportunities to grow credit. We re-accelerated credit over the last quarter, and we think that that continues to grow. We're close to 8 million customers in Mexico, which really positions us already as one of the leading financial institutions in Mexico. And as you know, we've asked for a banking license. We applied last year. We've received a couple of back and forth from the regulator. Everything else so far is going as expected. And hopefully, that process continues to go well, and we can get that banking license over the next month or so. So far, we feel very good with the opportunity market, very large market, 120 million people, higher GDP per capita than Brazil, only 12% credit card penetration that hasn't really moved in over three decades. So, it's a perfect configuration for full disruption with our business model. And kind of the branding that we build, the consumer base that we build, all the different pieces are falling into place, and we are excited about continuing to invest heavily in growth in this market.
Brian Flores: Thank you. And just as a follow-up, so in terms of your credit risk models, are you already comfortable in terms of increasing a bit more aggressively your credit portfolio going forward?
David Velez: Yes, so this is, the way we do credit is that it's a dynamic decision. It literally is a weekly decision. We look at data actively, really daily data. We look at the market, we see a performance for different cohorts, and we accelerate on one end or we deaccelerate on another end. You'll see that the growth curves that we've had in basically all our products in Brazil and Mexico tend to be curves that are not straight lines. They tend to have phases of acceleration, phases of pauses. That's because we launched a new model, we integrated a new data source, we're testing a new algorithm. And so in Mexico, that's what's happening. I think right now, if you look at some of the numbers on Q2, we're going through a bit of an acceleration phase. We see good opportunities to growth. But if we might pause a bit, if we see something that works in a certain area, we might accelerate a little bit more if we get more comfortable. So this is a very much dynamic decision. But in general, we see a market that is really wide open. And the methodology that we've really perfected, or we're in the process of perfecting in Brazil around low growth, beginning with the unbanked population with low credit limits, and low and grow it. Get to know the customer for the first 15, 30 days, increase limit a bit more, get to know the customer a little bit more. That dynamic way to approach risk is something that lends itself very well so far in Mexico, a market that has little access to credit. So we're very optimistic about that opportunity.
Youssef Lahrech: And just a little bit more color on the credit quality trends we've been seeing, when you look at the trajectory, since we introduced Cuenta product with a very high yield, attractively priced yield, what we've seen, in fact, is a nearly doubling of our credit card, customer originations, right. So a number of customers come in to enjoy the high yield, but also take a credit card at the same time. Those customers tend to be positively selected and much better credit quality. And so you add to that to the fact that the data we get on the Cuenta actually helps us underwrite better, you add that to the fact that we now have more experience in the market, more test results, more returns from the foundational testing we've been doing since the early days. So that gives us a lot of confidence to continue to grow credit and underwrite better as we go. And if you look at, credit quality indicators, either the ones we disclosed as Sofipo, or otherwise in Mexico, there's significant improvement year-over-year. And I would say credit quality has been lately behaving better than our own expectations. So as David said, we continue to be very optimistic, very excited about prospects for growth in Mexico.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Craig Moore from FT Partners.
Craig Moore: I wanted to ask about the evolution of the credit card market in Brazil. Maybe if you were able to break down your growth in both spending and loans between customers who are taking their first credit card versus those where you're winning share away from other banks. And secondly, I wanted to ask about Mexico and how you're viewing the non-traditional competition, say from like a MercadoLibre who's being aggressive in the consumer finance space. Thanks.
Guilherme Lago: So, Craig, let me take the first question. And if you don't mind, I'll try to combine that with the second, because it's good to draw a parallel between the credit card markets in Brazil and the credit card markets in Mexico. So Brazil has a credit card market that is relatively mature in terms of penetration. So credit card penetration accounts for nearly 50% of the population in Brazil compared to about 12% in Mexico. But people often use credit cards in Brazil as a means of payments, not as a means of financing. And therefore, historically, the IBB interest bearing balance as a percentage of the total receivables of credit cards in Brazil has been below those of the other Latin American markets at about 20% to 25%. In Mexico, conversely, consumers tend to use credit cards more as a means of financing than as a means of payments. And therefore, IBB over total credit card receivables tends to be much higher, more in the 60% to 65% of the total credit card receivables. So very, very, very different markets with very kind of different nuances, but both having fairly compelling unit economics for the product. Therefore, given the penetration of each country, the customers that we get in Brazil have been historically customers that had a banking relationship with another bank, but that we have groomed and upgraded and graduated to a healthier and higher credit life with us. Whereas in Mexico, the main opportunity that we have there is more related to financial inclusion, is really to offer kind of a banking product and credit cards for the 85-plus percent of the Mexican population who are currently unbanked or under banked.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to David. David, please go ahead.
David Vélez: Thank you, Jorg. Good evening, everyone, and thank you again for being with us today. In the last quarter, our business model, anchored in three fundamental principles; customer growth, expanding revenue per customer, and efficient operating costs, has once again demonstrated its strength. We have consistently surpassed expectations in net customers addition, achieving 110 million customers by the end of the quarter, reflecting a 56% increase from the 70 million recorded just two years ago. Strong customer additions in Brazil continue to fuel our growth, with an average of 1.1 million new customers each month and bringing the total to 98.8 million at quarter-end. As we announced over the past days, we already crossed the mark of 100 million customers in Brazil. Mexico also experienced strong growth, with 1.2 million net ads in the quarter, resulting in a total of 8.9 million customers. This success reinforces our strategy of increasing deposit yields in the country, further enhancing our momentum and solidifying new as the leading digital financial platform in Mexico. Moreover, Colombia has reached a significant milestone of 2 million customers and sustaining the positive momentum from the launch of the Cuenta product. Now, let's review some key financial highlights. Despite the depreciation of Latin currencies against the U.S. dollar during the quarter, our revenue surged to $2.9 billion, driven by our successful cross-sell and up-sell efforts, along with our introduction of new products. This solid performance reflects a 56% year-over-year increase. Our gross profit stands now at $1.3 billion, marking a 67% year-over-year growth, with a gross margin of 45.8%. Net income also saw robust growth, reaching $553 million, leading to an annualized return on equity of 30%. Additionally, our adjusted net income hit $592 million, expanding 10% sequentially and 89% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. These achievements underscore the power of our business model, which combines robust top-line growth with solid profitability. In this slide, we demonstrate how our flywheel effectively drives customer engagement, as evidenced by strong cohort performance on revenues. This consistent compound growth across all cohorts underpins our ability to cross-sell and up-sell to our customers. Increased product adoption boosted by primary banking relationships, which we will further discuss in this presentation, drives increasing ARPAC as cohorts mature over time. This trend is evident across all cohorts in this chart, including the more mature ones, which continue to display robust revenue CAGR, not only revenue CAGR for all cohorts acquired this decade is in the triple digits. Now turning to profitability. We have been presenting this table for several quarters now. In addition to the robust growth observed quarter-after-quarter, it is important to highlight that in the third quarter, for the first time, Nu Holdings return on equity surpassed 30%, demonstrating the success of our strategy. This achievement was accomplished while still maintaining a robust level of excess capital of $2.4 billion at the holding level, with two subsidiaries in Mexico and Colombia yet to reach profitability. As we make progress in our three geos and execute against this strategy, we continue to be extremely excited with the huge opportunity we have ahead around expanding our platform, increasing market share in our core products, and better monetizing our existing customer base. In addition, as we had stated earlier in the year, the growth into new verticals as part of our money platform strategy is starting to become a reality and broaden our total addressable market. Recent examples in this strategic path are the launches of new sell or de-booting telecom services as well as the developments of new marketplace, new travel, and new pay. And we're just getting started. With that, I'd like to pass the floor to our CFO Guilherme Lago, who will go into more details on our financial results. Over to you, Lago.
Guilherme Lago: Thank you, David, and good evening, everyone. As David mentioned, we reported another robust quarter market by sustained revenue growth, enhanced customer engagement, and strong operating margins and profitability. Now let's take a closer look at our third quarter results to gain deeper insights into the progress we have achieved against each of our guiding pillars. Starting with customer acquisition, we experienced strong growth during the quarter, welcoming 5.2 million new customers to our platform. We closed the quarter with 109.7 million customers, reflecting a 23% year-over-year increase. As we continue to add more customers, our focus starts to shift to engaging and retaining them. Our active user base increased by 24% year-over-year, accompanied by another sequential increase in our monthly activity rate, which now stands at 83.6%, up from 82.8% a year ago. This represents the 12th consecutive quarter increase in activity rate, underscoring our ability to consistently provide a compelling value proposition to our customers. Moving on to revenue expansion. The first chart on Slide 10 shows that Nu has established primary banking accounts with approximately 60% of our active customer base. This strong performance highlights our ability to capture a larger share of wallet among our customer base. Additionally, we are very pleased to see how recent cohorts are reaching this level of principality at an accelerated rate. As shown in the chart in the middle of this slide, the average number of products per active customer now stands at 4, highlighting the effectiveness of our cross-selling strategy even as we rapidly onboard more and more new customers. By successfully introducing our products to these new customers, we reinforce our position as their primary banking partner. The final chart shows the combined impact of these two powerful dynamics. Significant customer engagement, as depicted in the first chart, together with our expanding cross-sell capabilities, as shown in the second chart, allow us to deliver increasingly favorable performance. So, while our average monthly ARPAC stands at around $11, our more mature cohorts are already achieving a monthly ARPAC of $25. It is also worth remembering that the dynamics of ARPAC in this slide is affected by the acceleration of our customer base in Mexico and, more recently, in Colombia. While our deposited strategy in this new juice may attract customers who initially engage with the Cuenta product only, a product that generates relatively low ARPAC levels, we are very confident in the long-term results that this growth strategy is expected to yield for our new bank, as we have seen in Brazil for almost a decade now. As shown on the left chart of this slide, while our monthly ARPAC declined $0.02 to $11, on an effects-neutral basis it grew 2% sequentially and a strong 25% year-over-year, up from $10 just one year ago, and in spite of the customer pick-up of the new juice previously highlighted. We remain confident in our ability to increase ARPAC to its full potential over time. The chart on the right side of this slide highlights that our revenues hit a new record high this quarter of $2.9 billion, up 56% year-over-year. This growth was driven by the increase in active customers combined with higher ARPAC levels. Our consumer finance portfolio, which comprises credit cards and lending, grew strongly during the third quarter of 2024, up 47% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over-quarter both on an FX-neutral basis and reached a total of $20.9 billion. This growth was fueled by increases across both product categories. Our credit cards portfolio continued to grow during the quarter, fueled by further expansions in the shares of wallet across all customer segments, increasing 33% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter on an FX-neutral basis to $15.2 billion. Now, our lending portfolio posted especially strong performance, growing 97% year-over-year and 19% quarter-over-quarter on an FX-neutral basis to $5.7 billion. Lending continues to outpace credit cards and now accounts for 27% of the total portfolio. In line with trends from previous quarters, our lending cohorts demonstrated strong credit performance, allowing us to continue scaling originations. Now let's turn to the breakdown of our credit card portfolio. Interest earning installments remain steady at 28% of our total credit card portfolio, aligning with expectations shared last quarter. While demand for our peaks financing products remains strong, we have intentionally slowed the pace of eligibility expansions to more closely monitor performance over the coming quarters. If the portfolio continues to perform well, we may resume growth in the near term. Our focus is on gathering additional data to ensure our credit models remain resilient. The demand for this product is very clear and we are strategically managing supply to safeguard credit quality and maintain portfolio resilience. In terms of our lending business, originations increased by 79% year-over-year to R$15.9 billion in the quarter. Unsecured lending remains the main growth engine, which this quarter alone generated R$13.4 billion. This demonstrates our ability to continue fostering financial inclusion in Brazil, making credit available to people who previously didn't have access to this product. Now, our secure lending origination reached R$2.5 billion during the third quarter of 2024, accounting for 16% of total lending originations. We are pleased with the good performance we are seeing from the recent introductions of new features for public payroll loans, such as portability, top-ups, and refinances. Now, to expand eligibility and the total addressable market, or TAM, we have signed nine new collateral agreements, reaching a total of 11, including with the armed forces and several major Brazilian states and municipalities. The integration of these entities are ongoing, and once completed, we will tap into more than 70% of the overall TAM for public payroll loans in Brazil and release the product for the newly eligible customers, thus supporting continued growth in originations. Now, equally exciting is the performance we have seen in the originations of FGTS-backed loans. This product currently accounts for over 50% of our total originations of secure loans, and our market share of new originations already exceeds 25%. This reinforces the strong product market feat of our fully digital distribution channel. The reduction in credit yields you see in this slide is primarily a result of the increasing share of secure lending within our total originations, as secure landings typically offer lower yields and lower risks than unsecured loans. Now, moving on to funding. Our total deposits for the quarter increased to $28.3 billion, up 60% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis and supported by robust expansions across all of the three geos in which we operate. In Brazil alone, deposits reached $23.5 billion, up 6% sequentially on an FX-neutral basis. In addition, we believe our depot rate strategy in Mexico and Colombia is delivering strong results, allowing us to increase deposits in both countries while expanding our mission to empower our customers to gain more control of their financial lives. This has also led to additional cross-sell opportunities and improved unit economics for our new bank. At the close of September, our operations in Mexico reached $3.9 billion in deposits, almost 4x more than three-quarters ago. Now, lastly, we are very pleased with our recent performance in Colombia. Just one quarter after the launch of New Colombia's checking account product, consumer deposits reached $900 million, far exceeding our expectations. Net interest income, or NII, increased 63% year-on-year. On a sequential basis, NII remained flat in nominal dollars at $1.7 billion and expanded 4% quarter-over-quarter on an FX-neutral basis. This slow down in growth was mainly driven by the combination of three factors. First, yields on the credit card portfolio declined, reflecting [indiscernible] and customer risk. Second, lending yields declined as previously mentioned in this presentation due to the increasing mix of secure lending. And third, funding costs were pressured by the deposits ramped up in Mexico and Colombia and in line with our depot rates strategies in new geos. This also impacted net interest margin, or NIM, which compressed 140 basis points to 18.4% this quarter. Now, as we look ahead, and irrespective of the direction of local interest rates, we are confident that the key driver for future NIM will be 15% per year back in November 2023, almost 400 basis points above the TIA. By October 2024, this rate had already dropped to 12.5% per year, only 200 basis points above the TIA. Now let's shift our focus to the very last pillar of our strategy, maintaining a low cost to serve. We firmly believe that our platform is among one of the most cost effective in serving customers within our markets. Its low cost to serve represents a significant competitive advantage, and we expect this cost to remain at or below $1 per active customer for the foreseeable future. And for yet another quarter, we successfully achieved this goal with a cost to serve per active customer at $0.80. On an FX neutral basis, this represents a 2% year-over-year increase when adjusted for the one-offs in the third quarter of 2024, mostly related to FX impacts on data and cloud costs that had been allocated under customer services and now were reallocated to G&A. During the same period, our ARPAC grew by 25% and this highlights the strong leverage of our business model. Our gross profit amounted to $1.3 billion, reflecting an increase of 3% quarter-over-quarter and 67% year-over-year, both on an FX-neutral basis. Now our annualized gross profit margin is stood at 45.8%, closer to 2023 levels and in spite of the higher cost of funding in the new geos where we operate as anticipated during this presentation. Achieving operational leverage is a fundamental aspect of our strategy. During this quarter, our efficiency ratio improved by 60 basis points quarter-over-quarter, reaching 31.4% and more than 360 basis points better than a year ago. This was achieved even with costs for the third quarter increasing 2% sequentially on an FX-neutral basis, mainly reflecting a one-off in marketing expenses related to the repositioning of the Nucoin program and the impairment of capitalizing tangible assets associated with it. We are poised to capitalize on our platform's operating leverage as we continue to expand our customer base, up-sell and cross-sell products, introduce new features and achieve profitability in the new markets of Mexico and Colombia, which are currently in their investment phases. Lastly, we delivered another quarter of robust profitability, with net income increasing 107% year-on-year to $553 million. This resulted in an all-time high net income margin of 19% and this positive result emphasized the success of our strategy and of our business model. Also, adjusted net income reached $592 million for the quarter, up 89% compared to a year ago. Now while we are pleased with our third quarter results, our commitment to long-term value remains unwavering. This long-term strategy may require short-term investments to maximize our future opportunities, even if they come at the expense of profitability for a few quarters. We do expect to continue to pursue a number of these strategic short-term investments over the coming quarters as we continue to seed new growth avenues for the company. Now, I would like to hand the call over to Youssef, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will walk you through key highlights of our asset quality and credit portfolio health.
Youssef Lahrech: Thank you, Lago. Good evening, everybody. Starting with NPL trends, our leading indicator to 15 to 90 NPL ratio declined once again during the third quarter, dropping 10 basis points from last quarter to 4.4%. 90-plus NPLs increased by 20 basis points to 7.2%, also in line with expectations. Recall that 90-plus behaves as a stock rather than flow metric in the sense that this quarter's 90-plus houses inventory that was in 15 to 90 from one quarter ago all the way to three quarters ago. Thus, to understand the movement in 90-plus from last quarter to this quarter, you have to trace it back to the change in 15 to 90 from four quarters ago all the way to last quarter. As discussed in past earnings calls, we are intentionally and strategically growing our lending book and expanding down the credit spectrum where we see attractive opportunities. In line with our credit philosophy, we prioritize decisions that optimize the net present value of the lifetime of our customer relationships rather than focusing solely on short-term NPL metrics. When we identify asset classes or customer segments with compelling risk-adjusted returns that promote responsible customer behavior, we actively pursue growth in these areas in line with our strategy of pursuing primary banking relationship status with increasing engagement and cross-selling and up-selling over time. As we will show in the following slides, this strategy has yielded increased revenue and greater resilience, more than offsetting the higher delinquency rates that come with it, all within our risk appetite. This slide shows asset quality trends, both 15-90 and 90-plus NPLs, this time on the basis of interest earning balances rather than total receivables. Here you can see a stable to declining trend in the last few years. This demonstrates that we have been rewarded for the additional risk we've taken, reinforcing our strategic decision to focus on maximizing NPV, i.e. the lifetime value of customer relationships rather than solely optimizing delinquency metrics. Aligned with the growth pace of our credit portfolio and early delinquency performance, credit loss allowance expenses increased by 6% on an FX neutral basis to $774 million this quarter. Finally, risk-adjusted NIM decreased by 90 basis points in the quarter as a result of the 140 basis point decrease in NIM as explained by Lago earlier, which was partially offset by a 50 basis point improvement in cost of risk. On a year-on-year basis, risk-adjusted NIM increased by 110 basis points, underscoring once again the result of our focus on optimizing the lifetime value of our customer relationship cohorts. With that, we're now ready to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. We will now start the Q&A session for investors and analysts. [Operator Instructions]. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jorg Friedemann, Investor Relations Officer.
Jorg Friedemann: Thank you, operator. And our first question comes from the line of Jorge Kuri at Morgan Stanley.
Jorge Kuri: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great numbers. I wanted to ask about Nu sell. Can you maybe share with us what's the business model like? What is the revenue model? Are you charging a commission? Are you renting the network and then creating your own revenue or just basically passing on the revenues to the carriers? What are the unit economics? How profitable this could be? How do you see this impacting your financials over time? Is this something that could potentially be material, such consensus be start thinking about it, or is this sort of like an add-on that adds to the overall ecosystem without necessarily becoming a big part of your P&L?
David Vélez: Thank you. Jorge here, David. Thank you for your question. So listen, take a little step back. When I go back 10 years in time and I remember the industries that we were discussing around opportunity for disruption in Brazil and Latin America, there were two classes of industries that were in the companies that were disliked the most by Brazilians. The first ones were banks, the second ones were telecoms. That has changed over the past 10 years. We like to think maybe because we brought more competition in the industry, but on the telecom side, there's still a lot of opportunity to improve consumer experience. The NPS is low. The general offering for consumers is very complex. Seven, when we talk to customers, seven out of the 10 things that customers talk the most about their plans is around the user experience. There is too many different plans, too many different bonuses, too many different footnotes and just overall too much complexity. So, that combination of an industry that has hundreds of millions of lines in Brazil combined with low consumer experience creates a very obviously target for us as we as a company see our mission to be fighting complexity to empowering people. So we've been looking at the industry for a long time. I think the complexity of entering the telecom space, especially as an MVNO is, as many people have mentioned, generally you have disincentives with your provider. Because if you're growing too much, you're cannibalizing the MNO that is giving you access to the network. So it took us for a long time to try to find the right partner in the right contract to be able to negotiate a deal, in this case with Claro [ph], that align fully incentives. And what this really means is instead of just simply passing a fixed fee, we have our revenue share contract. We're not able to disclose exactly what the revenue share is, but it's a situation where we're sharing revenue, we are providing, we're using all our infrastructure and efficiency to serve consumers at a lower cost that they can. And so ultimately, they're able to serve customers through us making revenue at a lower cost. So it's a win-win situation for both companies. If we succeed in offering a product that tens of millions of consumers love, our partner is going to be making more money and is going to spending less money serving those customers. And obviously, there is a huge amount of synergies around the consumer base that we have. We are getting close to 60% of the Brazilian adult population, over 100 million Brazilian customers. So we have to spend very little money on customer acquisition and marketing. There is a huge amount of synergies on serving customers efficiently. We know how to do that for different sub-segments. For us specifically, there is a lot of value in creating a digital ecosystem. This is something we've been speaking about for several quarters now where we think that there is a big opportunity to go beyond financial services in new verticals. That allows us to give more products and services to our customers and increase the value propositions consistently to them. So we can do that by adding something that all of our 100% of our customers use every single day. And there is a lot of synergies in cross-selling the products and adding rewards on top of that. So that's something that we are launching. I think this first value, this first announcement, or the first plan, you should see it as a beachhead, as an entry path into this space, but there is a ton more to come in terms of how we're going to be tying all of these products together and how we're going to expect increased loyalty and the value proposition to customers as we add new sales, but also travel, we've announced travel, marketplace, and a number of other verticals that are here to come. In terms of financial benefit, I think it's early to tell, we are excited about this profit pool and also what this can bring to the financial services space and other segments. So I will behold, I won't get into a lot of details there, but I do think that the opportunity to go beyond financial services once you start adding a number of different verticals is pretty substantial and not only substantial in terms of revenues, but also in terms of diversifying the business model away from credit and having a much more robust, less cyclical type of revenue, much more fee revenue, much more subscription revenue, that adds a nice distribution and diversification to our overall business model. So it's the first, we're just kind of taking the first baby steps in that direction, but I think the logic is very compelling and we're very excited about what we can do there.
Jorge Kuri: Thank you, David. That was very clear.
David Vélez: Thank you, Jorge.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Mario Pierry at Bank of America.
Mario Pierry: Hey guys, thank you for taking my question. Let me focus on the current business rather than the future business. When we look at your risk adjusted net interest margin, it declined. When I look on a nominal terms, when I look at the margin itself also declined a few basis points. And I get that part of this has to do with a change in mix, you're doing more secure lending. But I was wondering as this continues to happen, I think that's part of the strategy, how does that impact your profitability in the short term? Because it seems to me like you're moving away from a very profitable product, which is credit cards to a product that is more secure, but less profitable, especially when we look at the payroll loan market in Brazil, given that you have regulated prices there. So I'm just trying to understand how do you see the evolution of risk adjusted margins as you continue to shift your loan mix? Thank you.
Guilherme Lago: Thank you. Hi Mario, this is Lago, thank you so much for your question. When we look at our business portfolio, they are certainly composed by asset classes with a very different kind of risk returns, provided that none of those asset classes are expected to yield us returns on equity of less than 30%. So yes, the first product that we had, credit card, has a phenomenal set of unit economics both in Brazil and Mexico and Colombia, lending as well, and we are by no means moving away from those asset classes, we are actually adding additional asset classes to that portfolio without necessarily diluting the unit economics of the prior ones. In my view, Mario, when you take a look at our balance sheet, we still have a loan-to-deposit ratio of about 30% to 35%, depending on how you cut it. So by and large, two-thirds of all of the deposits that we have are sitting idle in treasury bonds. So as we shift the allocations from treasury bonds into credit assets, both secured and unsecured, you should expect to see NIMs expanding going forward, you should expect to see risk adjusted margins expanding going forward. What has been kind of the rationale behind the contraction in NIMs in the third quarter of 2024? I think it is the composition of three things. Number one, we have seen increasing kind of funding costs in our business in Mexico and Colombia, given our strategy to aggressively pay higher deposit rates in those countries. And as such, it has now shrunk the NIMs on a consolidated basis. Going forward, we do expect to bring some of those deposit rates in Mexico and Colombia down as we have been doing sequentially quarter-over-quarter. So that's the first thing. The second thing within our credit portfolio in Brazil, you started to allude, yes, we are seeing the average yield go down, primarily because of mix, like secure lending gaining more weight, but also because of price elasticity, even within credit card, as we improve and optimize the price elasticity models, we have been able to play around with lower rates in order to maximize the NPV and the lifetime economics of the customers. So in a nutshell, we do not expect the movement into new asset classes to contract NIMs or risk adjusted NIMs. On the contrary, it should expand as we increase loan-to-deposit ratios.
Mario Pierry: Okay, that's clear. Let me follow up then, when we look at your credit cards, when I look at TPV, it contracted quarter-over-quarter and you are at a point where you have been gaining market share. So I wanted to understand then, when we look at this purchase volume, why did it decline quarter-over-quarter? And my question also has to do, like when I look at the number of cards outstanding in Brazil, it seems like it declined by 100,000, right, from 38.1 million to 38 million this quarter, even though you added 3.4 million clients in Brazil. So what is this data telling me, are you at the point where you already are at a certain level of market share that would be hard for you to gain market share from where we are right now?
Guilherme Lago: Yes. No, it's a good question, Mario. I think just let me try to address those two points that you've raised specifically and then I'll try to provide a general review on market share and credit cards. So first, I will draw your attention to Slides 27 and 28 of our earnings presentation. And you will see that our purchase volume in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, but mostly in Brazil have not contracted, they have actually expanded on an FX neutral basis. You should note that there has been a material FX devaluation in the third quarter of 2024. I think that the devaluation in Brazil has been between 4% and 5%, the devaluation in Mexico has been between 10% and 11%. So if you do an FX neutral adjustment, you will see that PV has actually gone up in the third quarter. And then if you look at the PV for Brazil, which you highlighted, Mario, is over the past 12 months, PV in Brazil for Nubank has grown by about 24%, which is about twice the growth of the PV in the industry. That means that we have, of course, increased market share. If you look at it in terms of receivables, the credit card receivables of Nubank Brazil do increase by about 32%, which is almost 3 to 4x the increase in credit card receivables of the industry. So again, the market share continues to grow. So when you look at every single segment in which we play, the less affluent, the more affluent as well as the total market share, we continue to gain no market share at a fairly good pace. Our estimates that in terms of credit card receivables in Brazil, our market share has grown by about 300 to 310 basis points over the prior 12-month period. So, we are super encouraged by the ability to continue to gain market share in the country. Now, to your second point, yes, indeed, the number of active credit cards has been slowing down to the number of active credit cards denominated in terms of PV has been flat at around 38 million credit cards. In terms of revenues it has gone up from 45.3 to 45.8 million, but it certainly will grow in the coming quarters and years in Brazil at a slower pace than it grew in the prior years. However, if you take a look on slides put here, on Slide 28, you will note that notwithstanding the stabilization of the number of active credit cards, we do expect the purchase volume per active credit card to continue to go up quite strongly. And that's what we have seen both from old cohorts as well as from new cohorts. On average, the purchase volume per active credit cards goes up by about 3x within 24 months. So I think when you combine the maturation of the cohorts and the increase of receivables, we do expect market share to continue to grow in Brazil, let alone the expansions that we're going to have in Mexico and Colombia.
Mario Pierry: Okay, that's clear. When I was talking about the purchase volume of credit cards decelerating, I was looking in BRL and I saw a growth of 3% quarter-on-quarter and you were growing like 8% previous quarter. You were growing at a higher pace. But okay, no, yes, your answer is very clear. Thank you.
Guilherme Lago: Thank you, Mario.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Tito Labarta from Goldman Sachs.
Tito Labarta: Hi, good evening, everyone. Thank you for the call and taking my question. My question, following up a little bit on the decline in NIM, but Lago, you have mentioned that you're intentionally slowing the pace of eligibility for Pix financing and trying to get some more data there. Just want to understand, are you concerned about asset quality? Is it just the strong pace at which you've grown over the last year? What's giving you a little bit more caution there? And will that be maybe a short-term headwind for your ability to expand NIM, let's say at least for the next few quarters, as you get to more comfort there?
Guilherme Lago: No, Tito, thanks for the question. Look, so we continue to be super excited with the Pix and Boleto financing products within the credit card family. The demand for this product is enormous. And the unit economics of this product is very strong. Now we do often pursue optimizations of the risk-return strategies of every single asset class. They are not kind of a straight line. So there are times in which we accelerate, there are times in which we decelerate. So over the past one or two quarters, we have slowed down intentionally the pace of eligibility expansion in Pix financing to kind of watch how those cohorts will continue to perform. And if they continue to perform well as they have, most likely we will resume growth over the course of the coming quarters. We do see kind of the Pix financing family of products as a strategic feature and product that we offer to our customers and something that actually leverages on many of the strengths of Nubank in Brazil. As you know, we have about one in every four Pix transactions in the country go through Nubank. So the flow of data is super strong and gives us and our customers the ability to develop and enjoy new financing products. So now we do expect to continue to grow this product in the coming quarters and years. We are just now taking a pause to see how the overall performance of the recent cohorts continue to perform.
Tito Labarta: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then I guess just another follow up on the margin, cause you had strong growth in deposits again, I know you're overpaying a bit in Mexico to kind of grow that deposit base. Would you consider maybe reducing the remuneration further either in Brazil or Mexico to help sort of on the funding side of things, particularly with high rates in Brazil and then conversely in Mexico, I saw that there was some October data where your loans jumped like 10% in October. So it seems like maybe you're getting more comfort to grow the loan book in Mexico. How do you think about the outlook for loan growth in Mexico from here?
Guilherme Lago: Yes. So just addressing some of your questions head on. In Brazil, we do not expect to lower the Cuenta yields or the deeper rates. We believe we have a very good balance of value proposition for our consumers and we are very pleased with the capital structure that we have in the country. So we do not foresee any material change in the short term. In Mexico and Colombia, we have been very positively surprised with the evolution of our deposits strategy in both of those countries. Not only we have seen kind of deposits increasing by substantially -- at substantially higher pace than we expected, but we have seen material second order impacts from the inflows of those deposits. What do I mean by that? I see the deposits has brought in now many more customers, but many more customers who also to whom we were able to cross-sell other products such as credit cards and now personal loans in Mexico and in soon Colombia. And we have also seen a marginal improvement in the mix of those customers that have allowed us to expand the eligibility and approval rates. And secondly, as was the case in Brazil, the inflow of deposits also comes with an avalanche of additional credit on the writing data that is now a super important raw material to feed our credit and customer segmentation model. So really pleased there. And as Tito, we improve the value proposition of their experiences with Nubank, we will consider progressively optimizing the cost of our liability and yes, potentially continue to lower deeper rates in Mexico and Colombia. In Mexico, just to have an illustration, I think we launched the deposits in Mexico back in the first quarter of 2024. We launched that paying 15% per year. At that point in time, it was around 400 basis points above the interbank deposit rates. Now we are now at 12.5% per year, which is only 200 basis points above the interbank deposit rates. And yes, we may bring this down going forward. But I think the most important benefit that we will have in NIMs is actually going to be on the expansion of the asset side of the balance sheet. And we are super pleased with the prospects that we have to increase the loan book in Mexico. It's performing fairly well and we have resumed growth as you have seen in the recent numbers, building the ones that we have posted with the regulators, I believe, yes, they are today.
Tito Labarta: Okay, perfect. Great. So it does seem like that could be a driver of growth going forward here?
Guilherme Lago: Yes. Absolutely.
Tito Labarta: Great. Thank you, Lago.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Geoff Elliott from Autonomous.
GeoffElliott: Hello, thanks very much for taking the question. The credit card Stage 3s increased from 9.1% to 9.8%. Can you give us a bit more detail on what's happening there? And specifically on Pix's credit, how has the performance of that portfolio been evolving? Thank you.
Youssef Lahrech: Hi, Jeff. This is Youssef. Thanks for the question. So Stage 3, the kind of shorthand that I think about is it's very correlated to what's happening to 90 plus. It tends to evolve in a similar way. It tends to behave like a stock metric. So what you're seeing is kind of consistent with the trend in 90 plus. When you look at more of a flow metric on late-stage delinquencies, I would invite you to take a look on page 30 at both the NPL formation and the Stage 3 formation. And both indicators, if you take a look, actually declined in the quarter, 40 and 60 basis points respectively. So we see actually improvement from that standpoint on those two metrics. And with respect to your question on Pix's financing, as Lago mentioned just a minute ago, we continue to be very pleased with both the consumer demand for that product and the economics of that product. The returns are phenomenal. And so, the recent deceleration is by no means an indication of concern on either. It's more of kind of technical adjustments we make on the business as usual basis that we've done in the past in a number of products and customer segments.
Geoff Elliott: Got it. Thanks very much.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of John Coffey of Barclays.
John Coffey: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. One theme that I've noticed in a lot of your answers is when you're talking about your NIM, I think you said that the NIM will improve when your loan-to-deposit rate improves, which makes a lot of sense. I was wondering if you could just maybe broadly say what's holding you back on having that rate more? Is it that you have capital and you're not using these assets and you're not able to convert those into loans just yet because you're still testing the market, perhaps in Mexico or Colombia? Were there any other reasons that might be sort of pulling back that ratio from rising more?
Guilherme Lago: John, thank you. Thanks for the question. So let me try to split the response into I think in between Brazil on one hand, the Mexico and Colombia on the other hand. So Brazil, we already have a fairly stable liability and deposit franchise and we have been growing the asset side of the balance sheet at a relatively good pace. Depending on the assets that you look, the overall portfolio has grown at about 47%, 50% year-over-year. The lending side, which is the one that consumes more funding, more than credit card in Brazil, it has in fact grown by about 90% to 100% year-over-year. So Brazil's assets is in a fast cruise control speed there and we expect loan-to-deposits to continue to go up. In Mexico and Colombia, they are more recent markets and therefore we continue to develop our credit underwriting capabilities. When we entered those markets, we did see that differently from Brazil, our core product, which was credit card, was more funding intensive due to the credit card cycle. So the first thing that we wanted to do was to de-risk the funding part of the business and therefore we have been more aggressive on raising deposits from local currency, general public, mostly retail deposits. Now that we have a very strong and healthy right side of the balance sheet, we are accelerating the growth of the left side of the balance sheet. And you have started to see a strong growth in the loan book of Mexico and Colombia and I believe you will not only continue to see this in the next quarters, but most likely it will even go up as we improve and sharpen our credit underwriting capabilities. But the main bottlenecks that we have to continue to grow the asset sides in Mexico and Colombia and to a certain extent also in Brazil, certainly not capital. We have plenty of capital to deploy, certainly not funding. We have now plenty of funding to deploy against those opportunities. It's really our credit underwriting appetite to be able to cherry-pick the most compelling risk-adjusted returns for our company.
John Coffey: Thank you very much. I just have one quick follow-up. This might be more for you, Youssef. On the 15 to 90-day NPLs, I know those decreased 10-bps quarter-by-quarter. Can you help us decrypt a little bit more how that breaks out from seasonality versus getting more exposure to riskier loans? Is it straightforward or are there too many moving pieces to really break that out?
Youssef Lahrech: It's pretty straightforward, to be honest. Seasonality typically is in the range of 10 to 20 basis points. What we see is largely along seasonal lines as opposed to indicative of any wholesale changes in the asset.
John Coffey: Okay, so it's normally 10 to 20 down from Q2 to Q3?
Youssef Lahrech: That's about right.
John Coffey: But you're also having more exposure to a riskier credit book, so I'd almost expect that would have maybe gone up or netted out to zero. It doesn't seem like that's happening?
Youssef Lahrech: No, there are offsetting forces, as we've talked about before. So you have increased specs of secured loans within the lending book. You have continued expansions in credit cards. Then you have some of the tactical adjustments we've executed through the last quarter. Those tend to offset each other. We've seen relative stability in the last quarter on that thing.
John Coffey: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Neha Agarwala from HSBC.
Neha Agarwala: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one on the provisioning level. When we go back to the 1Q numbers and the strong pickup in originations, which was the explanation for the strong pickup in the provisioning level, nominally speaking. When we look at this quarter, there was a very strong pickup, especially in personal loans, which grew 20% quarter-on-quarter. But the provisions grew only 6% quarter-on-quarter. So could you please explain what was different this quarter and why did we not see a stronger pickup in provisioning, whereas the origination was quite strong? And also the cost of risk sequentially remained largely stable. So there's probably some impact from shift in mix, but given the stronger growth in personal loans, I would expect cost of risk to go up. So if you could zoom in on that, that would be very helpful?
Youssef Lahrech: Yes, Neha, this is Youssef. Thanks for the question. So again, I would point out to some of the offsetting forces that I just talked about. And in particular, when you look at lending, the fastest growing element within that is secured lending, which carries very little risk and hence has lower coverage ratios. So that would explain in part what is going on. And even in unsecured lending, we've seen slightly better asset quality than expected. So you see a bit of an effect there, too.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Eduardo Rosman at BTG.
Eduardo Rosman: Hi, everyone. I wanted to get an update in Mexico. Maybe if that view could help us -- I think you've been delivering better and faster KPIs compared to what you did in Brazil. But I wanted to know if you think that Mexico is ready for the same impact you had in Brazil, right? Do you think Mexico can be relevant within your results in the next three years or should we expect to be more relevant further in the future? Thanks.
David Vélez: Sure. Thank you for the question. So, I mean, listen, Mexico is an opportunity that net-net I think could be another Brazil for us, but there are some differences to Brazil, some positives and some harder to crack. The positives are it's a higher income per capita country than Brazil. And you also have a lower bank penetration, lower credit card penetration. And that's a challenge as well as an opportunity with 12% credit card penetration. We could be if we crack the code of providing credit to the bank population. That would be a huge competitive advantage versus in Brazil where we found a market that was much more saturated with many more competitors. Now, it's going to be -- it's probably going to take a little bit longer to really reach the levels of market share that we have in Brazil, because cracking giving credit to the underbanked or the unbanked is just harder. And we're here for a long run. We don't want to do anything unnatural or learning how to do that requires a lot of discipline, a lot of methodology, a lot of data, a lot of foundational testing. And it's a quarter we accelerate, a quarter we pause and a quarter we accelerate or deaccelerate. So you'll see those six sagging of growth rates consistently because it's us continuously being better every single day around how to underwrite that market opportunity. Now, as you say, we've been -- so far has been faster than Brazil. And we're very excited with getting to in about five years, we're now Top 10 in Mexico in both credit cards and deposits, which is a huge victory, I think, in terms of our market positioning, having started from completely from zero. And there's been a huge amount -- there's a lot of huge amount of work around connecting to cash-in, cash-out infrastructure, which we're doing, connecting to new data infrastructure. So we're doing all the blocking and tackling. To your question specifically, I think Mexico will move the needle or is on path to move the needle for us. There is an upside case here where Mexico gets the picks right and the digital payment systems right or the next five years. And that upside case is Mexico being as big as Brazil for us. There's a base case where it takes a longer time to get all these digital payment infrastructure in place. And it moves the needle, but it's not as big as Brazil. But net-net, I think it's definitely a business that will move the needle for us and it will be relevant for us.
Eduardo Rosman: No, great, David. Thank you very much.
David Vélez: Thank you.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from Yuri Fernandes at JP Morgan.
Yuri Fernandes: Thank you, guys. Well, most of the strategic questions were already asked. So I'll go to the tax rate that was, I would say, a highlight in this part. When you go to your financial statement, we see the other line, the other tax shield. And basically it says that it's tax EFT bonds and other things. So just trying to understand what happened with tax rate. If this is just a seasonality, as we saw in 3Q 2023, I think back last year was Lei do Bem. So just trying to understand if this is a level that is sustainable for tax rate or we should see rates returning back to 33%, 34%, 35%? Thank you.
Guilherme Lago: Yuri, thanks so much for the question. I think in this quarter, there were two things in our income statement that I believe are worth highlighting in the call. One is a non-recurring event and the other one is a seasonal event. So what is the non-recurring event? So in the third quarter of 2024, we decided to reposition Nucoin, which is our loyalty program in a way that we would discontinue the crypto liquidity pool that was allocated to this program initially. Does no shift in the program require us to absorb a one time non-recurring charge of about $48 million that was fully absorbed in marketing and in general. So that is completely non-recurring. We should not expect this to have any additional impact to our performance. If it was not for this one time event, our efficiency ratio would have been even below 30%, so that one is completely non-recurring. With respect to the second point, which I believe you've asked on corporate income tax or the effective tax rate. That is more of a seasonal thing than a non-recurring thing. And you corrected pointed out, just like it happened in the third quarter of 2023, we have in the third quarter, a concentration in the filings for Lei do Bem, which is an R&D tax incentive that exists in Brazil that we also had in the third quarter of 2024. And that should be recurring and should continue with similar seasonalities in the coming quarters and years.
Yuri Fernandes: Super clear. Thank you very much, Lago.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from Henrique Navarro at Santander.
Henrique Navarro: Hi, thanks for the opportunity to make a question. I would like to do a follow up on the question on the growth mismatch between provisions and loans. I understand the rationale. You're changing the credit mix adding more secure personal loans. But my question is, if we look forward, the macro environment has been deteriorating. We have a higher estimates, et cetera. And under the expected credit loss provisioning model, we need to consider the macro environment to do our calculations. So my question is, what is the rationale for this behavior between provisions and loans? I mean, is there a risk that eventually you may need to reinforce provisions ahead? That's it. Thank you.
Youssef Lahrech: Hi, Henrique. This is Youssef. Thanks for the question. So, look, yes, we do take into account macro scenarios in our provision setting. They are one of many factors, as you know, that impact the provision model. But I would say that the dominant effect is, both the nature, the mix of assets and the performance of assets we put on book. And so I think, what you see in the financial statements reflect our best estimate in terms of coverage ratio. And as I mentioned, when you look at loans specifically, probably the main driver this quarter has been the accelerated growth of secured, which tend to drive coverage down vis-à-vis unsecured.
Henrique Navarro: Thank you.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Pedro Leduc at Itaú.
Pedro Leduc: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for the call and taking my question. Sorry to go back to the NIM piece. The first part of the question is easier. If you did have any of the credit card regulatory cap impacts on the NII or gross interest accrual for credit cards, other players mentioned it this season, and also if the renegotiated book took some part in the NII slowdown as well. Okay? And then the second piece to all of this, in the call you mentioned that you expect the NIM post-costal risk to improve going forward. Asset side, you mentioned funding, Mexico. But as I think about the main answer why it fell, you know, that the mix, that this secured portfolio is usually more stickier. So I would expect with the compounding effect to do have a more prolonged effect on the NIM post-cost risk. So really trying to get a little more color on how in the shape of this recovery that you're imagining? Thank you.
David Velez: Yes, Pedro, let me share some thoughts on this and then maybe Youssef can chime in as well. So with respect to the NIM in this quarter, one thing I would highlight, which adds a little bit of complexity to the calculation is also how FX has behaved throughout the third quarter of 2024. If you take a look at the average FX, which is the FX that is used to translate income statement and the end of period FX, which is the FX that is used to translate balance sheet items. You will note that the average FX has depreciated and the end of period FX has appreciated. So you're actually translating less dollars in the income statement divided by balance sheet items, which have kind of a higher amount of dollars. So you would see, if you adjust the FX both ways, a much less pronounced deterioration in NIMs, as you say. So I think that is the first part to your question, Leduc. The second part, which is where we see is all else equal. If we continue to have the same credit cards unsecured and we just increase the secure lending in our book and that increase in secure lending leads to an increase in loan to deposit ratio. We would be basically shifting money that is currently sitting at [indiscernible] in treasury bonds and placing it with secure lending. So all else equal, it should actually lead to an expansion of NIMs and an expansion of risk adjusted net interest margins as well. The problem is that the all else equal never happened. So you do see continuous growth in deposits in Mexico and Colombia, so on and so forth. But we do not agree with the notion that the growth of our secure portfolio per se will lead to a dilution in NIMs or even in returns on equity. It should lead to increasing loan to deposits and an expansion in both of those metrics.
Pedro Leduc: Thank you.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of William Tang at SIG.
William Tang: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I just have one for you here. Can you talk about the competitive market you see around secured lending, particularly in Brazil? Nu has clearly done incredibly well on the unsecured front. But how do the operating dynamics change when you start to think about leaving your mark on the secured front? How sticky are customers when thinking about shifting away from existing providers to Nubank? Thank you very much.
Guilherme Lago: No, thank you so much. This is a super important question for us, one that we debate and study at length. And the experience that we have had so far with the secured lending, which is a longer journey, seems to be quite encouraging. So within secured lending, there are basically three types of assets. You have the public payroll loans, you have FGTS, and you have investment backed loans. The first two account for about 90% of the loans that we originated and 90% of the book. So that is the lion's shares of our operations there. And in fact, the FGTS backed loans has accounted for the majority of the originations and the majority of our book today. In FGTS loans, which is the asset class for which we believe we already have reached at product parity, our origination is estimated to account for about 25% of the origination of the market. So very strong. And it does support the view that you can have a very successful direct-to-consumer digital only distribution channel. And we expect to continue to increase our FGTS market share in the coming quarters as we leverage on our low cost base to offer the product and the best user experience, best user interface and the lowest price points. Now, as we move into public payroll loans, we have been launching only two collateral agreements so far, which are the two largest ones, INSS and SIAPE. We have recently made fairly important improvements in those products for INSS. We've launched refinancing in November '24. SIAPE, we are going to launch refinancing in December 2024. And then over the coming quarters, we're going to add nine collateral agreements to the offer. So we expect that by December 2024, we will be launching the collateral agreements with the armed forces, and throughout 2025, many new collateral agreements with some of the largest states and municipalities in Brazil. So as we have seen with the success that we have had with FGTS, so too we expect to see kind of at the ramp up of public payroll loans there. And why do we think we are competitive out there? We think we are competitive because not only we have the best UX and UI, but the fact that we do direct-to-consumers, we have much lower customer acquisition costs, much lower cost to serve, which translates into much better prices to consumers in one of the industries in Brazil that offers the highest price elasticity points.
Jorg Friedemann: Thank you, Lago. We have now surpassed 75 minutes of this session. So we are now concluding today's call on behalf of Nu Holdings and of our investor relations team.

David Velez: Thank you, Jorg. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2024 was another pivotal year in our strategy as we continue advancing in our mission to fight complexity and empower people. Our consistent execution and customer-centric approach drove significant growth across all three geographies. We now serve over 114 million customers with 20.4 million net additions this year alone. Our active customer base grew 22% year-over-year to nearly 95 million. In Brazil, we continued adding over 1 million customers per month, serving 58% of the population and further consolidating our position as the third-largest financial institution in the country in number of customers. In Mexico, we achieved a significant milestone by surpassing 10 million customers, underscoring our strong growth momentum in the country. Beyond customer growth, we strengthened our deposit franchise, particularly in Mexico and Colombia, a crucial step in reinforcing our long-term strategy, bolstering our liquidity position, and enabling prudent credit expansion. Total deposits grew 55%, FX Neutral to $28.9 billion, while our interest-earning portfolio expanded 75% to $11.2 billion, also on an FX Neutral basis. We have maintained our high-growth trajectory, while significantly strengthening our financial results, demonstrating the efficiency and compounding power of our business model. Revenues grew 58% year-over-year on an FX Neutral basis to $11.5 billion in 2024, driven by sustained ARPAC growth, up 23% year-over-year in FX Neutral terms to $10.7. Our efficiency ratio in fourth quarter dropping below the 30% mark to end the year at 29.9%, making Nu one of the most efficient global financial services platforms and with room for additional optimization. Notably, net income almost doubled from 2023 to close to $2 billion with an annualized return on equity of 28%. These results place us among the most profitable financial institutions globally, even while maintaining a significant excess capital position at the holding level. These achievements underscore the power of our low-cost financial model, our commitment to customer engagement, and our ability to deliver sustained profitability at scale. With a strong foundation in place, we remain focused on extending our market leadership, launching new products, and deepening financial inclusion across Latin America. Now let's move on to the next slide to take a closer look at how we advance on our strategic priorities in 2024. First, in Mexico, we reached an exciting milestone of 10 million customers, up 91% year-over-year, now serving 12% of the country's adult population. Deposits grew significantly, increasing 438% from 2023 to $4.5 billion, reflecting our position as a trusted financial institution. Our credit card customer base expanded by 70% to $5.6 million and almost half of these customers did not have any credit card before ours, demonstrating our ability to help increase financial inclusion in the region. Over the last three years, our first payment default rate has improved by approximately 50%, while credit approval rates in Mexico have increased by 10%, underscoring the significant enhancements in our risk models and their impact on both credit performance and accessibility. We also expanded cash-in and cash-out access to over 30,000 contact points, a critical component of our long-term strategy to digitize and democratize financial services. Now, moving to secured lending in Brazil. This portfolio grew an impressive 615% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, representing 23% of our total lending portfolio. We signed nine new agreements with collateral counterparties in the public sector, expanding our total addressable market for payroll loans to 70% of the segment. As a result, 12 million of our customers are now eligible for payroll loans, along with an additional 80 million for FGTS loans. We also enhanced our portability solution and features and as of December 2024, 16% of INSS originations came from customers who brought their loans to Nubank and refinanced them under better conditions. At the same time, we capture over 30% market share in FGTS originations, underscoring our strategy's success and product market fit as well as the power of our low-cost distribution model. Building on our success in Brazil, we made significant strides with our high-income strategy, expanding our reach with close to 700,000 Ultravioleta customers, a 132% year-over-year increase. Credit card performance was also remarkable with quarterly purchase volume from Ultravioleta credit cards increasing 106% year-over-year to $1.8 billion in Q4 and accounting for 10% of our Brazilian credit card purchase volume. Our NPS of 84 continues to set us apart as the most loved brand among high-income customers alongside a 16% increase in brand consideration. Finally, our Money Platform is becoming a bigger reality. NuMarketplace had over 1 million customers shopping on our platform throughout the year. We also launched NuTravel, enabling customers to plan their trip seamlessly and securely within the app with the guarantee of the best price bundled with a multi-currency account for even greater convenience. And in an exciting development, we introduced NuCel, or MVNO service in partnership with Claro, further diversifying our offerings, strengthening Nu's ecosystem, and expanding our addressable market. As we continue making progress in our three geos, we remain very excited about the exciting opportunities we have ahead by expanding Nu's platform, increasing the market share of our core products and further monetizing our existing customer base. Additionally, capturing growth in new verticals with our Money Platform strategy is gaining traction, significantly broadening our total addressable market. The strategic expansion of our ecosystem has continued with the launch of NuCel in Brazil's massive telecom services market and the build-out of NuMarketplace. What's particularly exciting is that these are entirely new and significant avenues of growth for us along with NuTravel and NuPay. Reflecting on 2024, we're very pleased with the progress we've made across our strategic priorities, and we see several early indicators confirming that we remain on the right path. Nevertheless, our perspective is that it's still just day one. We remain focused, ambitious, and excited about what's ahead. And with that, I'd like to pass the floor to our CFO, Guilherme Lago, who will walk us through the details of our financial results. Over to you, Lago.
Guilherme Lago: Thank you, David. Good evening, everyone. As David noted, 2024 was an exceptional year marked by strong and consistent revenue growth, deeper customer engagement, combined with solid operating margins and profitability, all of which further validate the power and efficiency of our business model. Let's take a closer look at our fourth quarter results and how we have continued advancing across the key pillars of our strategy. Beginning with customer acquisition, we saw another quarter of strong growth, adding 4.5 million new customers to our platform and ending the year with 114.2 million customers, a 22% increase over 2023. As our customer base continues to expand, our focus shifts increasingly towards engagement and retention. Our active customer base also grew by 22% year-over-year with our monthly activity rate reaching 83.1%. Please note that activity dynamics in Mexico and Colombia differ from Brazil's as we refine our product offering in these two important markets. While customer growth in Mexico and Colombia outpaced Brazil this quarter, initially, lower activity levels in these two countries temporarily impacted our consolidated activity rate. Turning to revenue expansion. As shown on the first chart on Slide 10, Nu continued strengthening primary banking relationships, now representing approximately 61% of our active customer base. This strong performance underscore our ability to capture a larger share of wallet through effective cross-selling and upselling, further reinforcing our position as our customers' primary financial partner. We are also very pleased to see that recent cohorts are reaching this level of primary relationship at an accelerated pace. The chart in the center shows that the average number of products per active customer has now reached 4.1, also demonstrating the success of our cross-selling strategy even as we continue welcoming a growing number of new customers. By effectively introducing our products to these new customers, we deepen engagement and further strengthen our role as their main banking partner. The last chart illustrates the combined impact of these two powerful dynamics, best-in-class customer engagement, coupled with our growing cross-sell capabilities enables increasingly positive results. While our average monthly ARPAC stands at approximately $10.7, our more mature cohorts are already reaching $25, demonstrating the strong long-term monetization potential of our model. Please note that the ARPAC dynamics shown in this slide also reflects the accelerated growth of our customer bases in Mexico and more recently also in Colombia, while our deposit strategy in this market may initially attract more customers who engage primarily with the Cuenta product, one that generates relatively lower ARPAC levels, we are highly confident in the long-term value of this approach. As we have seen in Brazil for nearly a decade now, this strategy lays the foundation for deeper engagement and greater monetization down the road. As depicted in the left-hand chart, our monthly ARPAC experienced a slight decline of $0.03. However, on an FX-neutral basis, it expanded 5% sequentially and 23% compared to the prior year, despite rapid customer growth in the new geographies as I mentioned before. Again, we remain confident in our ability to continue increasing ARPAC to its full potential as our customer base matures with time. The chart on the right shows revenues hit another record-high this quarter of nearly $3 billion, up by 50% year-over-year. This remarkable growth was driven by the ongoing expansion of our active customer base and the strong ARPAC levels we continue to achieve. Our total credit portfolio also experienced robust growth in the fourth quarter of 2024, increasing 45% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter, both on an FX-neutral basis, reaching a total of $20.7 billion. This strong performance was driven by growth across both lending and cards. During the quarter, our credit card portfolio maintained its upward trajectory, supported by further expansion in the shares of wallets across all customer segments. This portfolio expanded 28% year-over-year and 9% sequentially on an FX-neutral basis to reach $14.6 billion. Meanwhile, our lending portfolio more than doubled during the year to $6.1 billion, a 22% sequential gain also on an FX-neutral basis. Lending continued outpacing credit cards, reaching 29% of our total portfolio. Consistent with previous quarters, our lending cohorts demonstrate strong credit performance, enabling us to further scale originations. This growth is driven not just by increasing customer eligibility, but also by gradually expanding ticket sizes and long durations, which remain a fraction of industry averages. This approach underscores our significant growth potential but also reflects our ability to navigate challenging environments with agility and resilience as we have demonstrated during previous economic downturns in Latin America. Now, let's look at a breakdown of our credit card portfolio. Interest-earning installments continue growing quarter-over-quarter. However, this growth was overshadowed by strong seasonal expansion in non-interest earnings balance, bringing the share of interest-earning installments down to 27% off of the overall credit card portfolio. Please note that this outcome aligns with the expectations that we shared last quarter following the intentional deceleration of financing for specific risk banks. Although demand for PIX financing products and their profitability remains very strong, we have deliberately tempered the pace of eligibility expansions during the second half of 2024 to carefully monitor the performance in the coming quarters and to assess what we call the second-order effects of this product on customer engagement and the long-term value of customer relationships. Now, at the beginning of 2025, after more extensive testing and adjustments, we began refining our PIX financing offer for different risk banks, taking into account customers' potential exposure to this product to mitigate any undesirable effects on asset quality or engagement across our platform. Given this approach and especially in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, we do not anticipate a significant expansion of PIX financing penetration, at least in the short term. Let's move to our lending business. Originations surged 84% year-over-year to BRL18.4 billion in the quarter. Unsecured lending remained the primary growth engine originating BRL15.6 billion and demonstrating our success in fostering financial inclusion for both individuals and SMEs in Brazil. Now our secured lending originations reached BRL2.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, representing 15% of our total lending originations. Notably, these originations are 100% in-house, generated exclusively through our platform and do not include portfolios acquired from third-parties. Equally exciting is the strong performance of FGTS-backed loans, which expanded to over 60% of our total secured lending originations. Nu's market shares of new originations in this product has already surpassed 30%, reflecting the strong market feat of our fully digital distribution channel. This year, we also made significant progress towards achieving product parity and we are pleased with the early performance indicators of new futures for public payroll loans in Brazil, such as portability, pop-ups, and refinancings. Additionally, we successfully integrated and launched operations with Brazil's armed forces, a very key milestone in expanding eligibility. To further grow our total addressable market or TAM, we have signed new collateral agreements now totaling 11, including partnerships with several major Brazilian states and municipalities. These agreements will allow us to reach over 70% of the TAM for public payroll loans in Brazil in the coming months, expanding access for newly eligible customers and supporting continued growth in originations. On the funding side, our total deposits for the quarter increased to $28.9 billion, up 55% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. This growth was supported by robust expansion across our three geographies. In Brazil, deposits reached $23.1 billion, an 11% sequential increase on an FX-neutral basis. Additionally, our deposit rate strategy in Mexico and Colombia continue to yield excellent results. It has significantly increased deposits in both countries, furthering our mission to empower our customers to take control of their financial lives, while also adding financial resilience and strong liquidity buffers to our operations in these countries. Even after reducing the spread over the Interbank rate, our operations in Mexico accumulated $4.5 billion in deposits, a fourfold increase from 2023, highlighting our ability to enhance cross-selling opportunities while still improving unit economics. Lastly, our performance in Colombia exceeded our expectations. Deposits reached $1.3 billion just two quarters after launching Nu Columbia's checking account and placing us among the country's top five financial institutions based on-demand deposits for individuals. Net interest income rose significantly, increasing 57% year-over-year and 9% sequentially on an FX-neutral basis, reaching a record high of $1.7 billion. Conversely, our net interest margin contracted 70 basis points to 17.7% this quarter. This was primarily driven by the very same factors that we highlighted last quarter. First, lower credit yields, reflecting ongoing shifts in both product mix due to the increasing share of secured loans and customer mix as we continue testing price elasticity in line with our improving risk profile. Second, funding costs also increased as a result of stronger deposit growth in Mexico and Colombia and consistent with our deposit rate strategy in these new geographies, which are still remunerating deposits at a premium to the benchmark rates. Additionally, FX movements once again negatively impacted our NIM as the FX rate used to translate the numerator depreciated more than the FX rate that applied to the average interest-earning assets of the denominator. Now, looking ahead to the mid and long-term profiles, we remain confident that the balance sheet optimization will be the primary driver of future NIMs, especially as deposits normalizations in Mexico and Colombia take place. Regardless of interest-rate trends, we see significant opportunity to expand originations by shifting funds from cash to credit. With our loan-to-deposit ratio still at significant low levels, we believe there is a lot of room to improve efficiency and further strengthen our profitability levels. Now, let's turn to the last pillar of our strategy, maintaining a low cost to serve. We continue to believe that our platform is one of the most cost-competitive in our markets and represents a significant competitive advantage. Accordingly, we remain committed to keeping our cost at or below $1 per active customer for the foreseeable future. Once again, we achieved this goal with a cost to serve per active customer of $0.80 of the dollar. On an FX Neutral basis, this represents an 11% year-over-year increase, largely due to seasonal spikes in data and processing usages. Simultaneously, our ARPAC grew by 23% over the same period, highlighting the strong operating leverage of our business model. Our gross profit reached $1.4 billion this quarter, an 8% sequential increase and a 44% increase from 2023, both on an FX Neutral basis. Gross profit margins stood at 45.6%, returning closer to 2023 levels despite higher funding costs we expected in our new geos. This performance also reflects the strengthening of our business model, which continues to deliver significant profitability even as we expand and invest in new markets. Over the past quarter, we continued demonstrating our ability to drive operating leverage as our business scales. Our efficiency ratio improved significantly, closing the quarter at 29.9%, an 150 basis points improvement from the previous quarter and over 610 basis points better than last year. This progress underscores the strength of our low-cost operating model, which enables us to sustain strong growth and drive product innovation while maintaining efficiency. With ongoing investments in technology and automation, we remain confident in our ability to further optimize our platform as we continue to scale. Net income in the fourth quarter reached $553 million, up 7% sequentially and 85% year-over-year on an FX Neutral basis, while our net income margins expanded 300 basis points to 18%. Additionally, adjusted net income for the quarter increased by an impressive 87% from 2023 levels to $610 million. Our strong bottom-line results further demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy and the resilience of our business model. While we are pleased with our fourth quarter performance, our focus remains on maximizing the long-term value of both our customer relationships and our company. This approach entails making deliberate short-term investments to unlock future growth opportunities, enhance customer engagement, and reinforce our leadership positions in the markets where we serve. Now, I'll hand the call over to Youssef, our President and Chief Operating Officer, to discuss asset quality and the overall health of our credit portfolio.
Youssef Lahrech: Thanks, Lago. Hi, everyone. Starting as usual with NPL trends. Our leading indicator, the 15-90 ratio, declined sequentially by 30 basis points to 4.1% in the quarter. Beyond the normal seasonal decrease we see in early delinquencies in the fourth quarter, this improvement was driven by mix shifts, one, towards lower-risk customers in credit card and two, towards lower-risk products given the growing mix of secured lending within our portfolio. 90 plus NPLs decreased by 20 basis points to 7.0% and as a result of past trends in 15-90, which have been decreasing for three quarters in a row now. Those decreases in 15-90 are now showing up in the 90-plus ratio, which as we've mentioned in past calls, behaves as a lagged stock indicator of long-dated delinquencies. This next slide highlights asset quality trends for both 15-90 and 90-plus NPLs, but this time on the basis of interest-earning balances rather than total receivables in the denominator. As you can see, the trends have remained stable to declining in recent years, reflecting the strength of our credit underwriting and portfolio management capabilities. This demonstrates that we are being rewarded for the additional risk we've taken, reinforcing our strategic focus on maximizing the lifetime value of customer relationships rather than solely optimizing delinquency metrics over the short term. Let's now turn to our renegotiated portfolio for an update on key trends. Renegotiations have remained relatively stable over the past year with the majority of their volume occurring before 15 days overdue as a result of our low friction proactive approach to this customer experience. This helps customers reorganize their finances early, lowering the risk of delinquency while minimizing the impact on NPLs. And as shown on the right-hand chart, we maintain a robust provision coverage level of more than 200% over 90-plus balances of our renegotiated portfolio, underscoring our prudent risk management and focus on resilience across our credit operations. In line with the growth of our credit portfolio, credit loss allowance expenses increased by 12% sequentially on an FX Neutral basis, reaching $804 million this quarter. In turn, risk-adjusted NIM compressed by 60 basis points in the quarter, driven by the 70 basis point decline in NIM explained by Lago earlier, partially offset by a 10 basis point improvement in cost-of-risk. To conclude this section, we are sharing an analysis conducted with one of our data providers, which compares the performance of our credit card portfolio to that of the Brazilian market. The six charts on this slide show 90 plus NPL time series segmented by risk band where the purple [Technical Difficulty] the gray line, the rest of the industry. As you can see across every segment, the portfolio consistently outperforms the industry, resulting in lower delinquency rates within an risk band. This reflects the strength of our credit underwriting capabilities, which are based on a more precise risk assessment of each customer and the sloping of credit limits to make them more appropriate to each individual customer alongside other factors, such as achieving a higher share of principality, meaning that more customers use Nu as their primary financial institution, which further enhances usage and repayment behavior and strengthens overall portfolio performance. With that, let me now turn the call back to David. David, go ahead, please.
David Velez: Thanks, Youssef. As we look ahead, we remain in the early stages of leading a profound transformation in financial services, both in Latin America and globally. Although we have maintained a remarkable growth trajectory since founding Nu, today we only capture a fraction of financial services revenue worldwide, which reinforces our belief in the vast opportunity still ahead of us. Our strategy continues to prioritize responsible and ambitious growth over short-term earnings gains, and we see 2025 as another pivotal year of investment during which we will deepen our presence in Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, expand our product portfolio, and lay the groundwork for our long-term ambitions. With this in mind, I'd like to outline our 2025 priorities to what we call our Three Act story. Starting with Act 1, building the largest and most loved retail banking franchise in Latin America. This is our focus today and where the majority of our resources, time, and focus remain allocated. While we have achieved significant scale, our market share still represents less than 4% in revenue terms, only a fraction of its full potential. In this growth phase, we will continue nurturing customer love, scaling our credit operations, and increasing principality in Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, all while delivering a seamless, fast, and globally reliable app experience. Moving to Act 2, expand beyond financial services. We embarked on this journey a few years ago with our entry into the marketplace, travel, and more recently telecom verticals. With a large and highly engaged customer base, one of the most loved and trusted brands in Brazil, and significant data and cross-sell capabilities, we believe we have earned the right to go beyond traditional financial services. Our goal is to create an ecosystem that broadens our addressable market and empowers customers to optimize their spending. Building upon the engagement and needs of our customers, we believe this strategy will enable the launch of new verticals in the future. And finally, Act 3, a global AI-driven digital banking model. This is our long-term vision. We endeavor to evolve our regional digital banking platform into a global model, leveraging artificial intelligence to provide hundreds of millions of customers with access to financial products and services that have historically been reserved for a select few. In 2025, we will take critical steps to turn this vision into reality by building the necessary foundations to support our products and services at a global scale. As our three-act story unfolds, our unwavering focus remains on execution, customer-centric innovation and sustainable growth. We have built a technology platform with the potential to truly redefine financial services across Latin America and beyond, and we're more than excited than ever about what lies ahead as we develop our platform to thrive in this new asset class. Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to another year of progress and positive impact. With that, we're now ready to address your questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jorg Friedemann, Investor Relations Officer.
Jorg Friedemann: Thank you, Operator. Could you please open the line for Jorge Kuri at Morgan Stanley?
Jorge Kuri: Hi, everyone. Congrats on the numbers. Thanks for the opportunity to ask questions. I wanted to ask about a comment that Lago made earlier regarding PIX. Can you just clarify what not expanding PIX in the short-term means? Is this not expanding it as a percentage of the portfolio? Or is it actually not expanded it in absolute balances, so that it will shrink, I guess, as a percentage of your total credit card portfolio? Thank you.
Guilherme Lago: Hi, Jorge, this is Lago. Thanks for your question. So what I meant is that we should not grow PIX financing as a percentage of the overall portfolio, not in absolute terms. So yes, overall, financing should continue to expand, but more in line with the overall expansion of our credit card portfolio in Brazil in the very short term. So as we mentioned in the prior call, we basically reduced the eligibility growth of PIX financing for the lowest kind of credit bands of financing, primarily to address what we saw some deteriorations in second-order impacts related primarily to NPS, churn, and engagement. And here, it's important to highlight that the overall profitability and resilience of the PIX financing portfolio continues to be remarkably positive, but we wanted to improve the way that the customer has been presented and the customer journey so as to minimize or even eliminate any potential negative second order impact. We have been working with our teams over the course of the past months in such improvements. We now have about 12 tests in the market to improve the journey of the customers. We are seeing some encouraging results and I'm encouraged to believe that we will be able to resume growth in percentage terms over the coming quarters, but I don't want to create any expectations that this resumption of growth will happen necessarily in the next one or two quarters.
David Velez: And, Jorge, let me add one point here related to this because I think it's a good opportunity to understand even go back to culture. This is a great example of a product that is very profitable and we've shown profitability and that if we were optimizing for short-term profitability, we would continue growing significantly. But here we have a choice to make, which is of prioritizing short-term earnings over improving in some ways the user experience. And as we've always said, we are optimizing for the long-run. We're optimizing for long-term consumer love. And we're just not happy necessarily with the second order effects on NPS. So we’d rather take it slower, continue improving the user experience, the user interface, the long-term NPS of the consumer and accelerate the growth once we are very comfortable with that. And it's -- I just think it's a good example of what improving and optimizing long-term NPS means, even though it might cost us a bit on the short-term earnings per se.
Jorge Kuri: Thank you. That's very clear. If I may add a follow-on because I'm guessing PIX has had an impact on your NIM and risk-adjusted NIM. Is it possible for you guys to help us understand the different moving parts. On risk-adjusted NIM, for example, I mean, Lago, you talked about the funding cost increase in Mexico and Colombia, the temporary increase in funding costs in Mexico and Colombia because you're growing the business had a negative impact on your NIM and taking on more risk and type clients and then the FX portion, can you sort of like walk us through the bridge of what each of these items has had the impact on say your risk-adjusted NIM, which is now 9.5% and it was 11% two quarters ago. So that 150 basis points more or less, how does it break-out between the different components?
Guilherme Lago: No, great question, Jorge. So in the fourth-quarter of 2024, our NIM dropped by about 70 basis points and you can probably see this in -- let me get here the right numbers, but you can probably see this in one of the slides that we have presented in the earnings. Out of those 70 bps drop that we saw, I would say that the most relevant factors were, number one, the FX, right? So the FX, we use different FX rates when we translate the local-currency into dollars, the denominator and the numerator. So the numerator is usually employing kind of average effects. The denominator is typically translated employing end-of-period effects and the use of those different FX rates explains about 44%, 45% of the 70 basis points contraction. The remaining 55% of the contraction is largely equally explained by two things. Number one, the drop in yields in the overall credit portfolio in Brazil as we grow secured lending more than we grow unsecured lending in terms of loan balance. And two, as a result of the growing deposits in Mexico and Colombia, which are still paying kind of interest that are higher than the intrabank deposit rates. So those are the three things, Jorge, that I believe justify the contraction of the NIM. Now, if we move to risk-adjusted net interest margins, you do have the same kind of 70 basis-points to which I alluded before. And then you have positive 10 basis-points on cost-of-risk performing is likely better-than-expected. Going forward, how do we see this? And so certainly, there are a lot of moving parts with respect to product mix with respect to Brazil versus our international geos, but we continue to believe that the most relevant outlook for NIMs and risk-adjusted NIMs is the optimization of the balance sheet. We continue to have a loan-to-deposit ratio that is below 40% as our loan book grows and we shift part of our liquidity from treasury bonds to credit portfolio, we do expect to see NIMs expanding in the medium-term.
Jorge Kuri: Thank you, Lago. That was exactly what I was looking for and thank you, David, as well.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Eduardo Rosman from BTG Pactual.
Eduardo Rosman: Hi, everyone. I have a question here regarding one of your slides. I think it's slide 26, I think Youssef, you show how Nubank has been performing, right, better than peers in credit cards underwriting, right? So I think that the loan growth strategy, the principality kind of explains in all part of that. But what about unsecured personal loans, right, which is where you've been kind of accelerating at the margin, right? Do you believe you can achieve the same level of outperformance as you did in credit cards? Is that a different product? How we should -- we should think about? Should we think about them combined? So if you could help us understand, it would be helpful. Thanks.
Youssef Lahrech: Hi, Rosman, this is Youssef here. Thanks for the question. You're right. So even though the analysis we presented here on Page 26 applies to credit cards, I expect the same dynamics to be playing out in unsecured loans as well. It's just in credit cards, it's a little bit cleaner as an analysis to do because you can -- you can identify those loans with a little bit more precision than unsecured loans, typically unsecured loans tend to be packaged with other types of partially secured or other types of collateral that would show up in various data sources that are hard to kind of parse out. But I would say, the ability to do low and grow in unsecured lending would show up in the form of very small tickets in the beginning for new customers, or customers that don't have a proven track record of repayment then over-time, we get repeat usage. When we get repeat usage and we have more performance data, we can actually increase the amount of loan exposure that we give out to a customer to be able to borrow. And likewise, the more data we have, the more precise our risk assessment can be. So like all those dynamics are applicable to unsecured lending as well, and we believe that credit underwriting expands to that product class equally.
Eduardo Rosman: Great. Thanks.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Tito Labarta from Goldman Sachs.
Tito Labarta: Hi, good evening. Thank you for the call and taking my question. My question on the secured lending. You mentioned here, you have $1.4 billion in secured loans. So, you seem to -- much bigger than kind of we had thought, I think it's the first time you disclosed this and you continue to grow the originations there. I just want to understand how do you think about the growth -- the continued growth of that both from FGTS and payroll loans, now that I think on the payroll loan side, you have signed several agreements, you have the portability, do you think this growth should accelerate even faster? Also, particularly in a year where macro is a little bit more challenging in Brazil, do you think this can really be a big driver of growth and profitability for the rest of the year? Just help us maybe contextualize the growth or the opportunity set of the secured lending portfolio?
Guilherme Lago: Tito, thanks so much for your question. And we couldn't be more excited with the growth of our secured lending portfolio and both kind of the direct P&L and unit economics that it brings, but also the strategic relevance of growing in an asset class that has proven to have a relatively good correlation with principality for our customers. But let me try to break down my responses in a few. So within the secured lending portfolio today, we basically have three asset classes. We have public payroll loans, we have FGTS and we have Investment Backed Loans. So public payroll loans, we have over the course of the last 12, 15 months being basically improving products and features, focused primarily on the two major collateral lines, namely INSS and SIAPE. By the end of 2024, I believe that we have reached what we call product parity with the market. So our customers today can do first loans, can do refinancing, can do top-up with portability. So we do expect that just relying on those two main collateral agreements, which account together for more than 50% of the target market, we will see an acceleration of our originations and loan portfolio throughout 2025. Now in addition to INSS and SIAPE, we have now signed over nine or 10 new collateral agreements, including with the Brazilian Armed Forces and the largest estates and municipalities of the country, which should only add fuel to the fire. And in fact, in January 2025, we have seen historical high originations for public payroll loans and secure lending in general. So we are excited with that -- with the prospects of secure -- public payroll loans secure lending. Now, going to the second asset class, FGTS, that has been what we believe to be a fairly successful entry strategy into a new product. We estimate that we already account for more than 30% of the originations of FGTS financing in Brazil, which we see with no positive lens for two reasons. First, it is a very profitable, very resilient asset class in itself, but also it showcases how successful a direct-to-consumer fully digital distribution channel can play out in Brazil and we hope to take the learnings that we have accumulated with FGTS into public payrolls. And then finally, the third asset class, which is investment backed loans, which accounts for give it or take, 10%, 15% of our total originations and we will continue to expand in line with the expansion of our customer base and asset class. So those three asset classes are what we consider to be today our secured lending and we think it will only pick up throughout 2025. It is also a also timely, Tito, to highlight the prospects of private consignado, which you have been writing about and many other people have been talking about, which is a completely new asset class that may be formed in Brazil, even though technically this asset class already exists today, the changes and improvements that are expected to be brought to the market can really unleash the growth of a new form of consumer credit in the country and it will not only be able to increase the size of the pie of consumer credit in Brazil, but also materially improve the terms and conditions of credits to Brazilian consumers. So we have been working very closely with the Brazilian government, with other industry participants. And we believe that this could be a very good opportunity for our customer base and for Nubank to continue to expand its share of wallet.
Tito Labarta: Great. That's very helpful. Lago, if I can, just a follow-up, just to think about the profitability of the payroll because it's a more secured product and yields are much slower and we were seeing risk-adjusted NIMs coming down. But I imagine you also have -- as you mentioned, you have a lot of capital, you can leverage up the balance sheet. So how do we think about profitability of payroll loans relative to the profitability of credit cards, personal loans and sort of where the bank is today?
Guilherme Lago: So, you are absolutely right, Tito. So the profitability if you measure this on ROE, the ROE of the secured lending asset class is in fact lower than the ROE of the unsecured lending and lower than the ROE of credit cards. However, I would not agree with the assertion that the growth in secured lending is expected to dilute our overall ROE. Why do I say so? Because we will not be growing secured lending at the expense of credit cards or at the expense of unsecured lending. We will basically be putting to work the excess of liquidity and excess of capital that we have in the balance sheet. So if I were to illustrate this more simplicity, we are basically now shifting part of our treasury bond portfolio in Brazil to fund our secured lending business, which in itself has much bigger NIMs and risk-adjusted NIMs for us. So it does have lower ROIs or lower ROEs, but it should not be dilutive to the overall level of profitability of the company. On the contrary, it should help us kind of optimize balance sheet deployment and overall profitability levels for the company. Not to mention, Tito, the fact that it is an important product to foster additional primary banking relationship, additional engagement, which in itself will bring kind of lots of long-term benefits to the relationship of Nubank with our now over 110 million customers in Brazil.
Tito Labarta: That's very clear. Thank you, Lago.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Thiago Batista from UBS. Yeah, Thiago your line is open.
Thiago Batista: Hello, hear me?
Jorg Friedemann: Yes, we can.
Thiago Batista: Okay. I have one question about the credit card business, especially in Brazil. When we look for the numbers in your market share by segment, since that Nu is approaching to kind of maturation of this product in the country, do you agree with the view that there is not a lot of room to expand in the credit card business in Brazil? And just as a follow-up on this point, we saw this quarter a contraction in the NII of credit card. Do you have -- this was caused by the Pix financing or there is explanation for this contraction in the NII of the credit card business?
Guilherme Lago: So let me -- thanks for the question. Let me try to get the reduction in the NII or in the yield of credit card, then I'll let Jorg or Youssef comment on how our credit card penetration across the segments and the growth opportunities that we continue to have within this product in Brazil. So generally, what you will see is that what we call credit card yield over the past two or three quarters has decreased in Brazil. That has been largely a function of two things. So as we continue to grow the -- our shares in our more affluent customers, namely what we call UV or Ultraviolet, there is a -- we operate with lower-price points when we enter more affluent customers. And as the growth of more affluent customers through UV has outpaced the growth of less affluent customers and therefore has gained relevance in our overall portfolio, it has contributed to a slight contraction in the credit card yield. The second thing, which is more related, Thiago, to the second -- to the last two quarters since the beginning of the second half of 2024, as we identify the second order impacts of PIX financing and we reduced the expansion of eligibility in these customers, that also has now created some headwinds for credit card yield. But overall, this is a product that continues to generate very healthy ROEs and very healthy levels of credit resilience, which we are very happy to continue expanding.
Jorg Friedemann: Yeah. Lago, let me complement on the question from Thiago. Thiago, I think the short answer is we still see significant room for growth in credit card in Brazil. I'll go through it sort of step-by-step. First of all, in the typical mass-market customer that we've historically served, you will note that we've made efforts to reengage customers, who were previously inactive and made some progress on that. That is an ongoing effort and we have a portfolio of initiatives against that through last year and into this year. And we expect incremental progress in continuing to have improvements in customers' activity, in purchase volume, et cetera. There are also significant opportunities we believe over the medium-term to grow into other segments where we've historically not played as much. I'll point out two of them. First is the high-income customer segment where over the course of 2024, we have well over doubled the number of Ultravioleta customers and also doubled our purchase volume from Ultravioleta credit cards as we've significantly worked -- we've worked to significantly improve that product. We've also started to get some very good early traction for small business customers, so called [indiscernible] in the credit card product. So steadily over the medium term and beyond, we expect that there is significant room to grow in our credit card product just in Brazil where as you will know, we've only had today about 14% market share as indicated by purchase volume. And so we don't think we're anywhere near the frontier of what is possible with the business model. Some -- there's more room for growth in the mass market, even though our shares are higher there. And there are many new segments, which we've been laying the groundwork for several years and in particular in 2024.
Thiago Batista: Very clear, Lago and Jorg.
Jorg Friedemann: Our next question comes from the line of Gustavo Schroden from Citi.
Gustavo Schroden: Hi, good evening, everybody. Thanks for the opportunity. My question is regarding the credit cycle. We've seen some signals of a potential deterioration in inflation, inflation for foods and we know that there is a high correlation between inflation and asset quality, also an environment of high interest rates, some questions about the macroeconomic environment, and we've seen mean the system or most of banks that we talk to adopting a more conservative approach on the credit concession. And I can see that according to this call and your awards, we can see that Nu is still, I would say, relatively positive in terms of credit growth. Of course, excluding the PIX finance, as explained, that you need to redesign the product. But on the other products, we can see you're still positive on the pace of growth. I'd like to understand what's the difference here, and if you do not have concerns about potential adverse selection in this environment. Thank you.
Youssef Lahrech: Hi, Gustavo, this is Youssef. Thanks for the question. Listen, I wouldn't say that we're not concerned about macro. In fact, just as a reminder, in our -- the way we underwrite credit in good and bad times, we're always very concerned about adverse effects from macro factors, external factors and just kind of generally unknown factors. And so this is why we always say that when we underwrite a loan or a credit card or any form of credit, we expect the future to be significantly worse than the past, right? Those are the assumptions that we put in our models to underwrite. They always have a significant stress from a forward-looking perspective and we've adhered to that philosophy throughout. This is not the first time that we face or we're facing a negative outlook with respect to Brazil macro in particular. And not only that -- it's a matter of outlook, we've actually gone through severe recessions throughout our 10-plus year history. So we have both a battle-tested portfolio and a battle-tested kind of underwriting framework around that. So we try not to time the market with a lot of precision because we don't think we have a better crystal ball than anyone in terms of forecasting short-term, what happens to macro, what happens to asset quality. And so we prefer to take a very conservative approach and assume that the future is going to be worse than the past at all times. And we've learned that in terms of our ability to withstand negative parts of the cycle, the decisions we make in good times when the macro is favorable tend to drive our performance in -- of the portfolio in bad times. And so, we think we've underwritten a portfolio throughout the cycles that is very resilient that can withstand over twice the amount of risk that we've observed and still be a profitable and above hurdle from an NPV perspective. And so we continue to underwrite with that level of caution built into the system. In addition to that, we're not blind to the fact that the forecast is -- has worsened in Brazil. And so when we do not just underwriting, but when we do allowance and provisioning, we do reflect a slightly worsened forecast in terms of how much we provisioned. So those are some of the ways we think about that and we remain really confident in our ability to continue to underwrite and continue to grow in both good and bad parts of the cycle as we have in the past.
Gustavo Schroden: Okay. Very clear. Thank you, Youssef.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Mario Pierry from Bank of America.
Mario Pierry: Hi, good evening, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question to David. On your last slide, you talked about building the critical -- taking the critical steps to build a global franchise or global scale this year. I wanted to hear a little bit more, what does this mean in terms of investments and costs. And exactly what is the plan? Are we talking about here then which markets are you looking to enter? Are you most excited about potential US franchise or expanding Southeast Asia, Africa or other countries in Latin America? So again, if you can give us a little bit more what are you thinking about becoming this global digital bank? And also what does this mean in terms of expenses in '25? Thank you.
David Velez: Sure, happy to. So the -- going back a bit to where we started the business, we've -- that the basic hypothesis of Nubank since 2013 is that the digital banking model that we are growing is the right business model to bank, 80%, 90% of the world population. 20, 30, 40 years from now, we're not going to be seeing people going to a banking branch. It's going to be much more of an exception than a rule, and we think about the past 10 years in Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia as having been able to prove that hypothesis, at least in the first market, which is Brazil. I think what we can show -- when we show our Brazilian business today, it's -- we can prove that this is a model that, number one, can reach more people and can include more people into financial services, can do it with a higher quality with a higher net promoter score, can do it with a much lower cost and also with a higher profitability. It's a superior business model because it makes every stakeholder better, consumers, investors, and employees. So -- and Mexico and Colombia is going in the same direction. I think we're very good -- we're very happy so far with the result that we've seen so far and it's following very similar paths to Brazil, even though the markets are differently in a number of different ways. So in a way, we think about the first 10, 11 years of Nubank history of proving the hypothesis in this core banking market in Latin America. Then the question is, how do we go for the next 10 years, and I think over the next 10 years, we'll continue to go after that hypothesis of testing this model really in more countries beyond Latin America. There are a number of complexities to do that. This is not an easy model to internationalize, especially the way we do it, which is we want to become the primary bank account of our customers. We're not just a wallet. We don't want to be just a wallet where you leave some cash to do some payments or some remittances. We want to be the primary bank account of customers. We think that's the most valuable strategic positioning in banking because of all the advantages that brings. And to be primary bank account, we have to go very deep in these markets. We have to get banking licenses. We have to get connected with a number of different local parties. So therefore, it has been a relatively slow internationalization. A big part of that speed of that internationalization has to do with our technology platform. Nobody in history, as far as we can tell globally, no other global bank, global consumer retail bank has been able to build a multi-country platform that is extremely efficient that has one core base, one code base that ultimately could give them a significant advantage in expanding. And that's what we've actually been building this already for about 18 months and probably have another 18 months to 24 months and is something that will continue maybe forever is having a core bank -- proprietary core banking platform that allows us to be in multiple countries that allows us to launch new countries with relatively low investment. So getting specifically to your question, what this really means is we're continuing to build this technology platform and this technology infrastructure through 2025. It's not going to be a meaningful expense change versus what we already have been investing. We've mentioned last year that 30% to 40% of our employees today are building products that are generating no revenue. So we're investing significantly for this next 10 years of evolution already. That is true for 2023, that is true for 2024, will be true for 2025, won't be a significant change versus what you've seen in 2024. And once we pick a country or countries, we're going to always do it in a way where it's more of a call option approach where we start slowly, we invest little money upfront. And as we get confidence and conviction about markets, we're going to continue to invest significantly. That's what we did Mexico, that's what we did Brazil. We launched Brazil with a million dollars. We launched Mexico with about the same. So you won't expect us doing big bang approaches in new big markets. We'll take a much more careful approach, testing the hypothesis at every angle, trying to leverage our own technology and our own capabilities and do it in a way where if we find the significant upside, we'll invest much more on that. So long answer to your question, which is effectively don't expect any meaningful changes in expenses that's already embedded in the type of expense and investments that we've already been doing for a few years.
Mario Pierry: Okay. No, that's clear. But when we think about it, right, like I think you mentioned that today you only have 4% market share of the profit pool or the revenue pool of the countries where you are operating. It feels like, right, it still is -- you are still at a very, very early stage in the current countries. Like, wouldn't it be more, I guess, would it make more sense first to continue to grow in these countries and make sure right that you get the strategy right, especially in Mexico, this feels like you're going in the right direction, but it will probably take a few more years before you become profitable and it's a very competitive market, right. The Brazilian market is also evolving. We've seen competitors ever since you entered the market, they're adapting, right. So my main concern is, okay, I get 30% to 40% of employees are working on projects that don't generate revenues today. But what about senior management, like the distraction, right, like that you are going to have when you try to become like a global franchise? So again, sorry for the question, but it feels like maybe a little bit too early that maybe you should be bigger in your existing countries before you start thinking globally.
David Velez: No, I think it's a phenomenal question. And I actually -- I think you're right and you're actually saying exactly what we are saying, which is the focus, and if you listen -- if you go back a bit to what I said initially, the overwhelming focus on management and the company remains on what we called Act 1. So Act 1, which is Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia continue to have over 90% of all the focus of the company. We think this is the highest priority. We continue to -- we think Mexico is a huge opportunity. We're very excited about the secured lending opportunity. Brazil, the 4% revenue market share that you mentioned in Latin America, it's tiny. There is a lot that we can do increasing the revenue shares, especially in the three countries that we operate, which account for 60% of the entire revenue share of Latin America. So as you and I are aligned, the point though is right now for internationalization specifically, getting ready is a multiyear effort. And so it is prudent to start investing 1%, 2% of our capacity to be ready to do that in a few years with much more investment of resources and energy. So we cannot do this fully sequentially. You got to do a little parallel execution there. 90% plus goes into core, even the 40% metric of employees investing in stuff that don't generate revenue, they are associated with Act 2, which is going financial services and that is associated with the markets that we are today. But for internationalization, specifically today is a tiny percentage of our capacity that is going into figuring out that next phase of growth that we have ahead.
Mario Pierry: All right. Now it's clear. Thank you very much.
David Velez: Thank you. Great question.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of John Coffey from Barclays.
John Coffey: Great. Well, thank you very much for taking my question. I saw that your principality is now at, I think, 61% of your active customers. So, up from 60% last quarter. I know this is probably going to be a challenging question to answer, but can you give me any kind of high-level way of thinking about what these 1 point increases in principality, what that could mean to the P&L and the model in general? Any like, again, views on what we should see if you went to 62% all other things being equal, what that impact would be on revenue, margins, net income?
Guilherme Lago: Yeah, John, thanks so much for your question. Look, I think wouldn't necessarily get too focused on principality going up by 1% or down 1%. There is some seasonality effects there, especially given how we measure principality, especially in the fourth quarter of the year. There is a higher concentration on purchase volumes and transactions that may kind of bring principality a little bit up and then eventually a little bit down. But I think if I step back and try to address your question, the primary banking relationship metric for us, which is a metric that we have been evolving over time is one of the most important operational KPIs for the company because we do believe that primary banking relationship is one of the holy grails of digital banking globally. Why do we say so? Because the ARPAC of a primary banking relationship customer is now 3 times to 4 times higher than the ARPAC of a nonprimary banking relationship customer. The delinquency of our primary banking relationship customer is 48% lower than the delinquency of a nonprimary banking relationship customer on an apples-to-apples basis. And so this is the way that our model has been construed. As David mentioned, we are not envisioning to be kind of the secondary wallet or an FX play. We often mentioned that we are not in the business of collecting social security numbers. We are in the business of becoming the primary banking relationship of our customers. And in a world, especially in Brazil, in which open banking or open finance is expected to unfold positively over the coming quarters. we think it is going to even increase the relevance of becoming the primary banking relationship of our customers. So, it's not only a long-term strategic angle. It's also a very short-term kind of P&L boost, and this is one of our primary kind of North Stars.
John Coffey: Thank you. One quick follow-up. On your LDR, which dipped from 40% to 39%, I was wondering if you could think a little bit about what the bottleneck is here of why that wouldn't get to maybe 45% in the near term. Is it -- would you say most of this is Mexico, where you have a big deposit base, but maybe you're still maybe battle-testing the credit model a little bit in that you're not really ready to deploy more of that capital immediately or is it something else?
Guilherme Lago: No, I think, look, let me address two points on this good question, John. So first, when you look at any financial institution with an LDR of 39%, I think the first question that one may ask is, look, why don't you drop the deposit rates that you're paying or why don't you increase the loan book that you have in order to optimize the balance sheet. I think the first approach is we do believe, as we mentioned before, that we want to be the primary banking relationship of most of our customers. And in order to achieve that, we do need to be the place where they make payments, receive payments, store value, and therefore having a very relevant deposit franchise is very strategic for us, not only from a primary banking relationship perspective, not only from a funding perspective, but also from a data acquisition perspective. So we do not see necessarily having a low LDR as a sign of weakness of the model. On the contrary, it should be seen as a way that we are getting more and more customers' principality and engagement through our platform. Now, of course, we do aim and we will love to be able to grow our credit book faster and faster over time in order to kind of optimize the balance sheet, but we also have to be fairly responsible that scaling credit books, specifically unsecured credit books, it's something that you have to do with a very systematic credit underwriting discipline and you cannot necessarily double or triple your credit book just because you got more deposits. You need to do so carefully and with the right level of credit resilience and thoughtfulness that we believe we have been doing over the past years. So that's, I think, the disconnect that we have been seeing over the past quarters. The growth in deposits in Mexico and Colombia over the past two quarters have certainly contributed to lowering our loan-to-deposit ratio. But in both countries, mainly in Mexico, we are very confident that in 2025 we'll see a very pronounced ramp-up in the velocity with which we grow the loan book there. Now, every single credit metric that we observe in Mexico is performing as per our expectation or even slightly better-than-expected and that will kind of lay the groundwork for us to continue to improve the balance sheet in each of those geos.
John Coffey: Thank you very much.
Jorg Friedemann: And our next question comes from the line of Yuri Fernandes, JPMorgan.
Yuri Fernandes: Good evening, everyone, and thanks for the opportunity for asking questions. I would like to ask about unsecured personal loans, if you can provide some more color on the strategy for these products, especially in Brazil. Very good originations. The product growing the fastest that you have, like more than secured lending that is a less mature product, right? When we look to the number of clients, it is growing, but it's growing a little bit less than the balance. So my question here is, like, where is the growth coming from, right? Is this a higher-duration strategy? Are you going to new customers? Is this linked to the lower loan yield we are seeing? So if you can provide a little bit of color. And just a question also related to this product. This is usually a higher-risk product for most of the time. And we do see you being more selective on PIX finance, but not this product, right? So why somewhat different approach between PIX finance and the secured personal loans? Thank you.
Jag Duggal: Yuri, thanks for the question. This is Jag. I'll try to answer your questions in order. First of all, I would mention to your last point that credit quality has been getting stronger in lending. And we look product line by product line at all of the trends, the first-order credit trends, second-order customer impacts, et cetera and make those decisions in a very granular way. So that basically describes why we are making the decisions we are making in lending and why they might be different in PIX financing or other products. Let me zoom out though and talk more broadly about our unsecured lending strategy. And as you've noted, we've seen very, very healthy growth over the quarter and over 2024 as a whole. There are a couple of hallmarks to what we've been doing that's been driving those results. First, we've significantly increased the mix of unsecured personal loans that are going to customers who have already taken a first loan with Nubank. And as a result, we understand and have vetted the risk dynamics. So an increasing mix of our personal loan portfolio, our second loans are loans to active customers versus in earlier years when the business was much less mature and much less scaled, we were offering loans to customers for the first time. So now, we're offering loans to customers who we vetted, who have either finished paying a loan or are on course to do so in a very healthy way, and we have greater confidence. That helps a second dimension of our success, although it's only a part of it, which is that we've been able to do two things simultaneously across our lending portfolio, which are the following. Adjusted for risk and that matters, but adjusted for risk for any given level of risk, we have been able to offer larger loans and we've been able to offer lower interest rates, better pricing to our customers over the course of 2024 through, as I mentioned, getting to know our customers better from a personal lending perspective and also through significant investments in credit modeling, which have yielded really significant results and we expect that to continue through this year as well. And the third thing I would mention is that similar to what I talked about in credit card where the bulk of our book was in the mass market historically, we are now starting to expand personal lending and adjust the product to be a better fit for new segments. And again, I'll mention the same two segments I mentioned when we talked about credit card, high-income and small businesses. And in high-income, for example, those customers require significantly larger max principles. They expect lower pricing given their lower credit risk on average. And that required significant testing on our part over the last 12-plus months. But as we've gone through that cycle of testing and experimentation, we are now able to provide that to a much better degree and we're seeing good response from our high-income customers, similar dynamic on the small-business side. So those are the key things that explain the significant success we've had in 2024 and Q4 on unsecured lending.
Yuri Fernandes: No, super clear, Jag. If I may follow up, just on duration, are you changing the strategy on duration? Are you able to -- with this more comfortable approach on the lending book? I remember it used to be around six months and the average duration for this product. Are you able to increase this? Like, how are you seeing like the term of the loans here?
Jag Duggal: Yeah, Yuri, that's a great question. I apologize for missing it on the first go-around. It's a great question. What I would say is we are incrementally -- we are working to increase duration as makes sense for our customers. And we are optimistic that we will be able to incrementally increase duration over time relatively slowly, but moving in that direction of longer durations. We have several efforts that are in, I would say they're relatively early stages of testing to make -- to move that -- move things in that direction. And so yes, I would expect to go in that direction, but I wouldn't expect that to be dramatic or rapid in terms of that trajectory.
Yuri Fernandes: No, great. Thank you very much.
Jorg Friedemann: Thank you, everyone. We are approaching 90 minutes of the call. So, I will have to end the session. So we are now concluding today's call. On behalf of Nu Holdings and our Investor Relations team, I want to thank you very much for your time and participation in our earnings call today. We are very excited with our developments in 2024 and we continue sharpening our execution to build a new asset class that goes beyond traditional financial services in the years to come. Over the coming days, we will be following up with the questions received by our platform and with those that attempted, but they're not able to ask questions tonight. So please do not hesitate to reach out to our team if you have any further questions. Thank you, and have a good night.
Operator: The Nu Holdings conference call has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",split transcript is available for premium subscribers only.,NU
2024,Q1,2024-02-01,"Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q1 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Before turning the call over to Tim, I would like to remind everyone that the quarter we're reporting today included 13 weeks, whereas the quarter we reported a year ago included 14 weeks. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Tim Cook: Thank you. Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $119.6 billion for the December quarter, up 2% from a year ago despite having one less week in the quarter. EPS was $2.18, up 16% from a year ago and an all-time record. We achieved revenue records across more than two dozen countries and regions including all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in many emerging markets with all-time records in Malaysia, Mexico, The Philippines, Poland, and Turkey, as well as December quarter records in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record with paid subscriptions growing double-digits year-over-year. And I'm pleased to announce today that we have set a new record for our installed base, which has now surpassed 2.2 billion active devices. We are announcing these results on the eve of what is sure to be a historic day as we enter the era of spatial computing. Starting tomorrow, Apple Vision Pro, the most advanced personal electronics device ever, will be available in Apple stores for customers in the U.S. with expansion to other countries later this year. Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary device built on decades of Apple innovation and it's years ahead of anything else. Apple Vision Pro has a groundbreaking new input system and thousands of innovations, and it will unlock incredible experiences for users and developers that are simply not possible on any other device. There is already so much excitement behind this product from reviewers, customers, and developers. They are praising everything from the incredible experience of watching a movie on a 100-foot screen to remarkable new machine learning capabilities like hand tracking and room mapping. We can't wait for people to experience the magic for themselves. Moments like these are what we live for at Apple. They're why we do what we do. They're why we're so unflinchingly dedicated to groundbreaking innovation and why we're so focused on pushing technology to its limits as we work to enrich the lives of our users. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future. That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year. Now, let's turn to the results for the December quarter, beginning with iPhone. We are proud to report that revenue came in at $69.7 billion, 6% higher than a year ago. The iPhone 15 lineup has earned glowing reviews and been embraced by customers. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous new design with color-infused back glass and contoured edges, Dynamic Island, A16 Bionic, and a new 48 megapixel camera system. And the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max set the gold standard for smartphones with a beautiful and lighter titanium design, industry-leading performance with A17 Pro and our most advanced camera system with the equivalent of seven pro lenses and the ability to record spatial video. Features like Emergency SoS and roadside assistance via satellite bring peace of mind to users when they travel, and I'm grateful for every note I've received about their lifesaving impact. Turning to Mac. Revenue came in at $7.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our latest M3-powered MacBook Pro models in spite of having one less week of sales. Just last week, we got to wish Mac a happy 40th birthday. When it was introduced 40 years ago, Mac changed everything, and through the years, it has done so again and again. Recently, we have been on a tremendous pace of innovation. Since the introduction of Apple silicon in 2020, we've been proud to offer our users unmatched performance and power along with a remarkable Neural Engine for artificial intelligence and machine learning. This past fall, we had an amazing launch of the latest generation of Apple silicon for Mac, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. These chips break new ground in power and performance empowering users to do more than they ever could before, whether they're making a musical masterpiece using the latest features in Logic Pro, or beating their high score in a graphics intensive game. A favorite amongst students, business owners, artists, and video editors, our MacBook Pro lineup is the world's best pro notebook family. And iMac, the world's most capable and best-selling all-in one, is now faster than ever, thanks to M3. In iPad, revenue for the December quarter was $7 billion, down 25% year-over-year due to a difficult compare with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the 10th generation iPad during the December quarter last year and one less week of sales. iPad remains the most versatile, capable, and elegant tablet on the market today. It continues to be the go-to-device for students, creators, and more with customers loving iPad's incredible combination of portability and performance. Powerful apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for iPad allow video and music creators to unleash their creativity in new ways that are only possible on iPad. iPad continues to push the boundaries of what's possible on a tablet. In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue came in at $12 billion, down 11% from a year ago due to a difficult compare with the launch timing of several products in this category and the impact of the 14th week last year. Across our latest Apple Watch lineup, we're enabling and encouraging our users to live a healthier day, while making Apple Watch even more intuitive to use. The new double tap gesture on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 make it easier to answer calls, play and pause music or take a photo with iPhone. I've been deeply moved by the many touching stories about how features like a regular rhythm notification and fall detection helped Apple Watch users when they needed it most. And for the first time ever, users can choose a carbon-neutral option of any new Apple Watch. Meanwhile, our AirPods lineup continue to be a holiday favorite. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record of $23.1 billion and an 11% year-over-year increase. Because we had one less week this quarter, this growth represents an acceleration from the September quarter, and we achieved all-time revenue records across advertising, cloud services, payment services and video, as well as December quarter records in App Store and AppleCare. Across our services, we're constantly growing our offerings to give users even more to love. With the redesigned Apple TV app, we've made it easier for subscribers to enjoy all their favorite shows, movies and sports, including Apple TV+ hits like Masters of the Air, Monarch, and Slow Horses. We're proud to be a part of Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a film that has moved audiences and earned more than 200 accolades including Best Film of the Year from the New York Film Critics Circle, nine BAFTA nominations, a Golden Globe win, and 10 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Across all Apple TV+ productions, we've now earned 2050 award nominations and 450 wins since we've introduced the service. We're also excited to have a new season of Major League Soccer kicking off this month. We're looking forward to seeing Lionel Messi return to the field and to following all of our favorite teams in what is sure to be an incredible season. And we're counting down to the Apple Music Super Bowl halftime show, featuring Usher. Turning to Retail. In recent months, we opened three stores, including our 100th store in Asia-Pacific. Throughout the holidays, our team members pulled out all the stops to help customers find the perfect gift. And I know our U.S. team members are especially excited to begin demoing Apple Vision Pro for our customers tomorrow. At Apple, we live and breathe innovation. We are driven to pioneer new technology that can enrich our customers' lives, and we're just as intentional about showing up with our values and being a force for good in the world. February is Black History Month, and to honor it, we've launched our new Black Unity Collection, which includes the Black Unity Sport Loop band. This year's designs reflect a lasting commitment to working toward a more equitable world. We also continue to do a central work through our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, and we're proud to continue providing grants to organizations that are making a real impact in the world. In recent months, we've also taken significant strides in our environmental work. We're partnering with suppliers to bring more clean energy online for Apple production. We're using more recycled materials than ever before and more energy-efficient transportation than ever before. And each day, we are taking more and more steps toward becoming 100% carbon-neutral across all of our products by 2030. Apple is a company that has never shied away from big challenges. That's because we are grounded by a deep sense of purpose and guided by core belief in the transformative power of innovation. And so, we are optimistic about the future, confident in the long-term, and as excited as we've ever been to deliver for our users like only Apple can. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $119.6 billion, up 2% from last year. During the December quarter a year ago, two unique factors affected our results. First, we had an additional week in the quarter. And second, we had COVID-related factory shutdowns that limited iPhone supply. We estimate that the net impact of these two factors resulted in a 2 percentage point headwind to our revenue performance this quarter. We set all-time revenue records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific, and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets with double-digit growth in the majority of the emerging markets we track. Products revenue was $96.5 billion, flat compared to last year, driven by strength in iPhone, offset by challenging compares for iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories and one less week of sales this year across the entire portfolio. Thanks to our unparalleled customer loyalty and very strong levels of customer satisfaction, our total installed base of active devices set a new record across all products and all geographic segments, and is now over 2.2 billion active devices. Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year. When we take into account the extra week last year, this represents a sequential acceleration of growth from the September quarter. We are very pleased with our Services performance in both developed and emerging markets with all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific. Company gross margin was 45.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 39.4%, up 280 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 72.8%, up 190 basis points from last quarter, due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.5 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 1% year-over-year. Net income was $33.9 billion, up $3.9 billion from last year. Diluted EPS was $2.18, up 16% versus last year and an all-time record. And operating cash flow was very strong at $39.9 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We set all-time records in several countries and regions, including Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, and Korea, as well as December quarter records in India and Indonesia. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, and we had an all-time record number of iPhone upgraders during the quarter. Customers are loving their new iPhone 15 family, with the latest reports from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 99% in the U.S. In fact, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world during the quarter. According to a survey from Kantar, iPhones were four out of the top five models in the U.S. and Japan, four out of the top six models in urban China and the UK, and all top five models in Australia. Mac generated revenue of $7.8 billion and return to growth, despite one less week of sales this year. This represents a significant acceleration from the September quarter when we faced a challenging compare due to the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Customer response to our latest iMac and MacBook Pro models powered by the M3 chips has been great. And our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter being new to the product. Also, 451 Research recently reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S. iPad was $7 billion in revenue, down 25% year-over-year. iPad faced a difficult compare because during the December quarter last year, we launched the new iPad Pro and iPad 10 generation, and we had an extra week of sales. However, the iPad installed base continues to grow and is an all-time high with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product, and customer satisfaction for iPad was recently measured at 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $12 billion, down 11% year-over-year due to a challenging launch compare and the extra week a year ago. This time last year, we had the full quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. We continue to attract new customers to Apple Watch. Nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product, and the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 96% in the U.S. And in Services, we were very pleased with our double-digit growth, which was driven by the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base is now over 2.2 billion active devices and continues to grow nicely, establishing a solid foundation for the future expansion of our Services business. And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Also, our paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. Finally, we continue to build on the breadth and the quality of our current services. From Oscar-nominated theatrical releases with Apple TV+ to more publications or News+ like The Atlantic and exciting new games on Arcade. Turning to Enterprise, we continue to see many business customers leverage Apple products to improve productivity and drive innovation. Target recently added the latest M3 MacBook Pro to their existing deployment of thousands of Mac’s, enabling employees across various departments to do their best work. In emerging markets, Zoho, a leading technology company headquartered in India, offers its 15,000 plus global employees a choice of devices, with 80% of their workforce using iPhone for work and nearly two-thirds of them choosing Mac as their primary computer. With the upcoming launch of Apple Vision Pro, we are seeing strong excitement in Enterprise. Leading organizations across many industries such as Walmart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg, and SAP have started leveraging and investing in Apple Vision Pro as their new platform to bring innovative spatial computing experiences to their customers and employees. From everyday productivity to collaborative product design to immersive training, we cannot wait to see the amazing things our enterprise customers will create in the months and years to come. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $173 billion in cash and marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $4 billion, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $65 billion at the end of the quarter, and our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20.5 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 6 million shares in the final settlement of our 19th ASR. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results at the end of this quarter. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. And we expect foreign exchange to be a revenue headwind of about 2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, in the December quarter a year ago, we faced significant supply constraints on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max due to COVID-19 factory shutdowns. And in the March quarter a year ago, we were able to replenish channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the constraints. We estimate that this impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter's total revenue last year. When we remove this impact from last year's revenue, we expect both our March quarter total company revenue and iPhone revenue to be similar to a year ago. For our Services business, we expect a similar double-digit growth rate to what we reported in the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on February 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?
Operator: Certainly. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erik Woodring: Hey guys, good evening. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. And congrats on the nice quarter here. Luca, maybe if we start with you. Can you unpackage some of the Services drivers a bit for us. Obviously, really nice outperformance in the December quarter versus your expectations. A record gross margin implies your higher margin businesses were likely the sources of outperformance. But can you maybe just clarify a bit how we should think about Services growth for the March quarter? And then, speak to some of those underlying drivers in the December quarter and then in the March quarter, what the different puts and takes would be? And then, I have a follow-up please. Thank you.
Luca Maestri: Thanks, Erik, for the question. Let's start with the December quarter. As we said, up 11%, $23.1 billion is an all-time record for us, with all-time records in The Americas, in Europe, and the rest of Asia Pac. So it was pretty broad-based geographically, and very strong across all the Services categories, because we had all-time revenue records for cloud, for payments, for video, and for advertising and December quarter records for the App Store and for AppleCare. Obviously, last year, we had an extra week, so the 11% is stronger than -- the underlying performance is stronger than the 11% that we have reported. I think the entire ecosystem is doing well because we continue to see growth and new all-time highs in both transacting accounts and paid accounts, which is obviously very important. And paid subscriptions continue to grow strong double-digits. Just as a reference, we have more than a billion paid subscriptions across all the services on our platform. This is more than double the number of paid subscriptions that we had only four years ago. So, obviously, very significant growth there. What I said during the prepared remarks around the March quarter, I mentioned that we will continue to grow double-digits at a percentage that is similar to what we reported for the December quarter. We don't provide guidance around the different services categories. So, we will provide more color when we report in three months.
Erik Woodring: Okay. Thank you, Luca. And then, Tim, really nice to see your installed base reach a record high, again, against all products and geos. I'm wondering if you could share a bit more detail about the new users you were able to on-board over the last 12 months. Meaning, how might this new cohort look different from past cohorts, either in terms of geographic representation or SKU to certain products or even how their monetization trends might differ from past cohorts. And that's it from me. Thanks so much.
Tim Cook: Yes. Hi, Erik. I would say emerging markets are -- have been a very key area of strength for us. If you look at it, India grew -- in revenue terms grew strong double-digits in the December quarter and hit a quarter revenue record. The other emerging markets like Indonesia also hit a quarterly record. And we had several regions, with records from Latin America to the Middle East. And that theme has been pretty consistent across the other quarters that -- of the year as well. And so, emerging markets, very, very important. And I feel like we are doing a great job there.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Erik. Operator, can we have the next question please?
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Mike Ng: Hey, good afternoon. I just have two questions as well. First, on Services. Just on the outlook for the March quarter for a similar double-digit growth rate as of December quarter. I'm just wondering why not -- why won't it be potentially faster, given that the December quarter obviously had a headwind from the extra week comp, and I'd also think that some of the pricing uplifts on select Apple One services that were implemented last winter should help in the March quarter? Any additional thoughts there would be great in terms of what some of your assumptions are. And then, I have a quick follow-up.
Luca Maestri: Yes. We'll see how the quarter develops. I would point to two things. One is the fact that we mentioned that we expect a couple of points of negative foreign exchange in the March quarter, and foreign exchange was essentially flat for us in the December quarter. So, you've got a bit of a headwind there. And then, when you look at our other progression of our Services business over the last few quarters, the compares for March are slightly more difficult than the compares for December.
Mike Ng: Great. Thank you, Luca. And then, my second question. It was very interesting to hear about some of the enterprise customer investments into Vision Pro. Could you maybe just talk about some of the efforts to support Vision Pro developer ecosystem. And it was also good to hear about the potential upcoming announcements on AI. So any thoughts there would also be helpful. Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yeah. Hi. It's -- we are incredibly excited about the Enterprise opportunities with Vision Pro. I've seen several demos from different companies. Luca mentioned several in his opening remarks, but Walmart has a very cool merchandising app. There are firms that are doing collaboration -- design collaboration apps. There are field service applications. Really all over the map, there are applications that are for control center, command center kind of things. SAP has really gotten behind it and, of course, SAP is in so many of companies. I think there will be a great opportunity for us in Enterprise, and we couldn't be more excited about where things are right now. We are obviously looking forward to tomorrow. This has been multiple years of efforts from so many people across Apple. And really, it took a whole of company effort to bring it to this far. In terms of generative AI, which, I'd guess, is your focus, we have a lot of work going on internally as I've alluded to before. Our MO, if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work and not to get out in front of ourselves. And so, we're going to hold that to this as well. But we've got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we'll be talking about later this year.
Mike Ng: Wonderful. Thank you, Tim.
Tim Cook: Yes.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Mike. Operator, can we have the next question please?
Operator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. I have two questions as well. First on iPhone. There have been concerns around replacement cycles lengthening, China competition intensifying, and you still beat iPhone revenues despite the weaker performance in China. Curious how you're thinking about the 15 cycle overall, given what you saw in the December quarter. And I've a follow-up.
Tim Cook: Hi, it's Tim. The -- we were up 6%, as we mentioned in the opening remarks. We are happy with that performance. Underneath there, we had really strong performance in several parts of the world with all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific. As I mentioned earlier, we did particularly well in several emerging markets from Latin America to the Middle East. And we set December quarter records in India and Indonesia. And so, really some spectacular broad-based reactions to iPhone. We also importantly set an all-time record worldwide for iPhone upgraders. And the installed base hit a new all-time high consistent with the -- our overall devices. And so, there's lot of good things. Luca mentioned in his opening comments that iPhones were four out of the top five smartphone models in the U.S. and Japan and four out of the top six in urban China and the UK, and all top five in Australia, and the customer satisfaction level for iPhone 15 hit 99%. If you look at iPhone 15 since the announcement of it and shipment in September, so this is including some of Q4 and you compare that to iPhone 14 over the same period of time, iPhone 15 is outselling iPhone 14. And so, we feel very good about that, and the upgraders hitting a record is particularly exciting for us.
Wamsi Mohan: Great. Thank you, Tim. And as a follow-up, obviously, you're just launching the Vision Pro and it's an entirely new category. It's a price point that's a much higher starting price point relative to most of your other, probably over the last decade, product introductions, but just wondering how would you measure the success of Vision Pro over time and which Apple products adoption curve would you look at as potentially the most similar? And is there a way in which we could think Vision Pro could eclipse maybe something like the iPad in revenue over time. Thank you.
Tim Cook: You know, each product has its own journey. And so, I wouldn't want to compare it to any one in particular. I would just say we couldn't be more excited. Internally, we've got an incredible amount of excitement from developers and from customers that can't wait till tomorrow to pick up their units. And we are incredibly proud to be able to demo the unit in so many of our stores in the U.S. starting tomorrow for people that are -- that want to check it out. And so, we'll see and report the results of it in the Wearables category that you're familiar with. I think that if you look at it from a price point of view, there's an incredible amount of technology that's packed into the product. There's 5,000 patents in the product and it's, of course, built on many innovations that Apple has spent multiple years on, from silicon to displays and significant AI and machine learning. All the hand tracking, the room mapping, all of this stuff is driven by AI. And so, we're incredibly excited about it. I can't wait to be in the store for tomorrow and see the reaction myself.
Wamsi Mohan: Thank you so much, Tim.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Wamsi. Operator, we'll take the next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani: Good afternoon. I have two as well. I guess, first off, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in China right now. I think from a geographic basis, one of the few places that was down double-digits, while everything else was growing. So, I'm hoping you spend a bit of time discussing what are you seeing there from a competitive perspective and more importantly, from a demand perspective in China?
Tim Cook: Yeah. If you look at iPhone in China Mainland, which I think has been the focus of a lot of interest, and you look at it in constant currency, so more of an operational view, we were down mid-single digits on iPhone. And so, it was the other things that drove the larger contraction year-over-year. On the good news side, we had solid growth on upgraders year-over-year in Mainland China and we had four of the top six smartphone models in urban China. Also, IDC just put out a note, that you may have seen, that we were the top brand in -- for the full year and for the December quarter. And so, there's some good news along with – obviously, we'd prefer not to [contract] (ph).
Amit Daryanani: Fair enough. And then, as a follow-up, you folks have implemented a fair bit of changes around the App Store in Europe post the DMA implementation there. Can you just touch on what are some of the key updates? And then, Luca, as a net of it all, do you see it having any significant impact financially to your services or a broader Apple P&L statement? Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes. You know, the -- let me try to answer a little bit of both and then Luca can add some comments to it. We announced a number of changes last week in Europe that would be in effect beginning in March. So, the last month of the first calendar quarter, the second fiscal quarter. Those are -- some of the things that we announced include alternate billing opportunities, alternate app stores, our marketplaces, if you will. We're also opening NFC for new capabilities for banking and wallet apps. And so, these are some of the things we announced. The -- if you think about what we've done over the years is, we've really majored on privacy, security, and usability. And we've tried our best to get as close to the past in terms of the things that are -- that people love about our ecosystem as we can, but we are going to fall short of providing the maximum amount that we could supply, because we need to comply with the regulation. And so, in terms of predicting the choices that developers and users will make, it's very difficult to do that with precision. And so, I will see what happens in March.
Luca Maestri: Yes, Amit. As Tim said, these are changes that we're going to be implementing in March. A lot will depend on the choices that will be made. Just to keep it in context, the changes applied to the EU market, which represents roughly 7% of our global app store revenue.
Amit Daryanani: Perfect. That's a really good perspective to have. Thank you very much.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Amit. Operator, can we have the next question please?
Operator: Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I have two as well as you would imagine. I guess, the first question I wanted to just ask maybe unpack a little bit more, just remarkable trends that we're seeing in your product gross margin specifically. So, I'm curious as we look forward, I guess on this last quarter, where there any kind of benefits you're seeing from like just the purchase component, obligations that you've put in place, let's say, a year ago, and that flowing through. And how are you thinking about the component pricing environment as we think about that gross margin into the March quarter and looking-forward?
Luca Maestri: Yes. On the product side and then maybe I'll make a comment in total for the company. On the product side, our gross margins increased sequentially 280 basis points. So, obviously, a very significant increase. I would say the two primary components of the increase are a favorable mix. Of course, iPhone did very well. We did very well with our high-end models. And leverage, of course, it's the biggest quarter of the year for us and so we get the leverage effect. We had a partial offset, negative impact from foreign exchange. But net-net, obviously, very significant improvement. And we had very similar dynamics on the Services side where we increased sequentially 190 basis points, also, in this case, due to a more favorable mix. And so, the combined effect of the two businesses gave us the 45.9% at the total company level, which is up 70% sequentially. You've heard from my prepared remarks that we are guiding total company gross margin to 46% to 47%, which is an additional expansion of margins compared to the already very strong results of the December quarter.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And then, the second question I was just going to ask. Tim, you alluded to kind of your excitement around generative AI and some announcements that we should think about maybe later this year. One of the things that stands out for me is that, your capital expenditures has actually come down this last year. I'm curious as you look to lean in more to generative AI, is there something we should consider about the CapEx intensity at Apple to make investments to really set the table for generative AI, kind of platform as we move forward? Just given some of the things that we've seen from some other large tech companies.
Luca Maestri: I'll take the question, Aaron. We've always said, we will never underinvest in the business. So, we are making all the investments that are necessary throughout our product development, software development, services development. And so, we will continue to invest in every area of the business and at the appropriate level. And we're very excited about what's in store for us for the rest of the year.
Aaron Rakers: Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Aaron. Operator, can we have the next question please?
Operator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one for Luca, a clarification on a question. The $5 billion impact in March quarter, is that for product revenue or is that total company revenue. And along the same part, you highlighted the strong gross margins. And I understand last year, some of the commodity costs were deflationary, buy looks like it’s going to be inflationary right now. And also you've done some of the Mac conversions that -- the silicon conversions. So I'm just trying to figure out how much juice is there more to squeeze on the gross margin side? And then I'll follow up for Tim.
Luca Maestri: Yes. The -- so the first part of the question was around -- oh, the $5 billion. The $5 billion, as I mentioned, a year ago we had this disruption of supply on iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max because of the factory shutdown due to the COVID-19 situation. And so, essentially there was pent up demand as we exited December quarter, they got fulfilled and we also did the channel fill associated with it during the March quarter. So close to $5 billion that I mentioned is entirely related to iPhone. On the gross margin side, obviously, we are at very high levels of gross margin. And I'll repeat what I said before, we've had good expansion over the last few quarters and now we are guiding to 46% to 47% and that takes into account everything that is going on, which is, the commodity environment, which is the foreign exchange situation, and obviously the product and services mix. And the outcome of this is the guidance, which obviously is very strong and we're very happy with it.
Krish Sankar: Thanks a lot, Luca. And then I have a follow-up for Tim. Tim, it was very interesting to hear your comments on enterprise. And historically, Apple has been a consumer centric company. And now with Vision Pro, Mac, it's sort of penetrating more into the enterprise. I'm kind of curious how to think about Apple of the future? Would it still be consumer centric or do you think it's going to be more enterprise focused also as we get into the future? Thank you very much.
Tim Cook: We've really concluded that we can do both. That if you look at it, what has happened over the last several years is that, employees are in a position in many companies to choose their own technology that is the best for them. And so, it sort of took some of the central command from the traditional company and decentralized the decision-making. That is a huge advantage for Apple, because there's a lot of people out there that want to use a Mac. They're using a Mac at home. They'd like to use one in the office as well. iPad has also benefited from that. Vision Pro, it's -- when you look at the ton of use cases, I mean, we're starting with a million apps and 600 plus that are -- have been designed particularly for Vision Pro. When I look at what is coming out of Enterprise, it's some of the most innovative things I've seen come out of Enterprise in a long time. And so, I think there's a like there is for the Mac and iPad, and of course, iPhone has been in enterprise since the early days of iPhone. I think there's a nice opportunity there for Vision Pro as well.
Krish Sankar: Great. Thanks a lot Tim. Very interesting to hear. Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish. Operator, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Vogt: Great. Thanks guys. And I have two questions as well. So, Tim and Luke, I appreciate the strength in the emerging markets like India and the other names that you kind of listed on the call, but can you maybe spend some time on the Americas? Obviously, that was relatively flat, you touched on China, but what are you seeing in that market from the carriers here in the States? And is the sales cycle elongating or the replacement cycle elongating? And in your view what has to change to kind of maybe re-accelerate that business in the America's, particular in the iPhone business? And then on sort of -- I just want to make sure I understand sort of the guide. So when I think about the $5 billion pull forward last year in the March quarter from a channel fill perspective, even if I back it out last quarter or I back it up this quarter, the March quarter, this would be sort of the softest quarter since the COVID pandemic. Obviously, I know the Americas as I just touched on is a little bit softer than China, which you cleared up earlier. But how do you think about the differences in sort of the macro conditions by region? And again, do you have a sense for are we nearing a trough from a macro demand perspective or how long do you think this particular weakness persists? Thanks.
Tim Cook: Let me take the first part of your question about America. If you look at the U.S., which obviously drives the vast, vast majority of the revenue in America, we grew in the December quarter from an iPhone business point of view and the install base hit an all-time high. If you look at the replacement cycle, it's very difficult to measure the replacement cycle at any given point. And so, what we focus on internally a lot is the active install base and the -- obviously, the sales over usually a cycle and we feel better about those things. If you look at the -- who's selling what in the U.S., the iPhone is four out of the top five selling smartphones in the US. And of course, the customer satisfaction in the U.S. as we alluded to earlier is 99%. So we feel very, very good about what our position is in the U.S.
Luca Maestri: And I would add to that, keep in mind, obviously, the extra week that we had a year ago that obviously makes the compare more -- a bit distorted. On the March quarter guide, I would point to you that, obviously, the COVID years had a lot of, let's say, turmoil in it, a lot of volatility that typically you wouldn't see. If you look at our sequential progression from December to March this year versus pre-COVID versus like a more normal environment, it's actually stronger than those years.
David Vogt: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, David. Operator, can we have the last question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Ben Reitzes: Yes. Hi. Thanks. Appreciate it. Two questions, if I can sneak them in. Just wanted to clarify on China. Tim, I think last quarter you still thought it was a growth market. Obviously, there's some concerns with the -- recently and given what we saw in the quarter, is there something that we can kind of point to where you feel that that market can resume growth in the future? And I'm wondering if you're still upbeat about that prospect. And then I just have a quick follow up.
Tim Cook: Ben, we've been in China for 30 years. And I remain very optimistic about China over the long term. And I feel good about hitting a new install base number, high watermark and very good about the growth in upgraders year-over-year during the quarter.
Ben Reitzes: Great. Thanks Tim. And just in terms of AI, I know you're not going to talk about your plans, but do you believe -- are you a believer in the edge thesis that AI and processing on smartphones and devices like yours is going to have a huge role in AI and AI apps and that it's something you guys can take advantage of.
Tim Cook: Let me just say that, I think there's a huge opportunity for Apple with GenAI and AI. And without getting into to more details and getting out in front of myself.
Ben Reitzes: Thanks Tim.
Tim Cook: Yes, Thanks, Ben.
Suhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thank you Ben. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

2024,Q2,2024-05-02,"Suhasini Chandramouli: Good Afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q2 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Tim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $90.8 billion and an EPS record of $1.53 for the March quarter. We set revenue records in more than a dozen countries and regions. These include, among others, March quarter records in Latin-America and the Middle East, as well as Canada, India, Spain and Turkey. We also achieved an all-time revenue record in Indonesia, one of the many markets where we continue to see so much potential. In services, we set an all-time revenue record, up 14% over the past year. Keep in mind, as we described on the last call, in the March quarter a year-ago, we were able to replenish iPhone channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the December quarter COVID-related supply disruptions on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. We estimate this one-time impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter revenue last year. If we remove this from last year's results, our March quarter total company revenue this year would have grown. Despite this impact, we were still able to deliver the records I described. Of course, this past quarter, we were thrilled to launch Apple Vision Pro and it has been so wonderful to hear from people who now get to experience the magic of spatial computing. They describe the impossible becoming possible right before their eyes and they share their amazement and their emotions about what they can do now, whether it's reliving their most treasured memories or having a movie theater experience right in their living room. It's also great to see the enthusiasm from the enterprise market. For example, more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought Apple Vision Pro units and are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren't possible before, and this is just the beginning. Looking ahead, we're getting ready for an exciting product announcement next week that we think our customers will love. And next month, we have our Worldwide Developers Conference, which has generated enormous enthusiasm from our developers. We can't wait to reveal what we have in-store. We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in Generative AI. We are making significant investments, and we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon. We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple's silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines and our unwavering focus on privacy, which underpins everything we create. As we push innovation forward, we continue to manage thoughtfully and deliberately through an uneven macroeconomic environment and remain focused on putting our users at the center of everything we do. Now let's turn to our results for the March quarter across each product category, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue for the March quarter was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year. We faced a difficult compare over the previous year due to the $5 billion impact that I mentioned earlier. However, we still saw growth on iPhone in some markets, including Mainland China, and according to Kantar during the quarter, the two best-selling smartphones in Urban China were the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max. I was in China recently where I had the chance to meet with developers and creators who are doing remarkable things with iPhone. And just a couple of weeks ago, I visited Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore, where it was incredible to see all the ways customers and communities are using our products and services to do amazing things. Everywhere I travel, people have such a great affinity for Apple, and it's one of the many reasons I'm so optimistic about the future. Turning to Mac. March quarter revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% from a year ago. We had an amazing launch in early March with the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air. The world's most popular laptop is the best consumer laptop for AI with breakthrough performance of the M3 chip and it’s even more powerful neural engine. Whether it's an entrepreneur starting a new business or a college student finishing their degree, users depend on the power and portability of MacBook Air to take them places they couldn't have gone without it. In iPad, revenue for the March quarter was $5.6 billion, 17% lower year-over-year, due to a difficult compare with the momentum following the launch of M2 iPad Pro and the 10th Generation iPad last fiscal year. iPad continues to stand apart for its versatility, power and performance. For video editors, music makers and creatives of all kinds, iPad is empowering users to do more than they ever could with a tablet. Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, March quarter revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% from a year-ago due to a difficult launch compare on Watch and AirPods. Apple Watch is helping runners go the extra mile on their wellness journeys, keeping hikers on course with the latest navigation capabilities in watchOS 10, and enabling users of all fitness levels to live a healthier day. Across our watch lineup, we're harnessing AI and machine-learning to power lifesaving features like a regular rhythm notifications and fall detection. I often hear about how much these features mean to users and their loved ones and I'm thankful that so many people are able to get help in their time of greatest need. As I shared earlier, we set an all-time revenue record in services with $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We also achieved all-time revenue records across several categories and geographic segments. Audiences are tuning in on screens large, small and spatial and are enjoying Apple TV+ Originals like Palm Royale and Sugar. And we have some incredible theatrical releases coming this year, including Wolves, which reunites George Clooney and Brad Pitt. Apple TV+ productions continue to be celebrated as major awards contenders. Since launch, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,100 award nominations and 480 wins. Meanwhile, we're enhancing the live sports experience with a new iPhone app, Apple Sports. This free app allows fans to follow their favorite teams and leagues with real-time scores, stats and more. Apple Sports is the perfect companion for MLS Season Pass subscribers. Turning to retail, our stores continued to be vital spaces for connection and innovation. I was delighted to be in Shanghai for the opening of our latest flagship store. The energy and enthusiasm from our customers was truly something to behold. And across the United States, our incredible retail teams have been sharing Vision Pro demos with customers, delighting them with a profound and emotional experience of using it for the very first time. Everywhere we operate and everything we do, we're guided by our mission to enrich users' lives and lead the world better than we found it, whether we're making Apple podcasts more accessible with a new transcripts feature or helping to safeguard iMessage users' privacy with new protections that can defend against advances in quantum computing. Our environmental work is another great example of how innovation and our values come together. As we work toward our goal of being carbon-neutral across all of our products by 2030, we are proud of how we've been able to innovate and do more for our customers while taking less from the planet. Since 2015, Apple has cut our overall emissions by more than half, while revenue grew nearly 65% during that same time period. And we're now using more recycled materials in our products than ever before. Earlier this spring, we launched our first-ever product to use 50% recycled materials with a new M3-powered MacBook Air. We're also investing in new solar and wind power in the U.S. and Europe, both to power our growing operations and our users' devices. And we're working with partners in India and the U.S. to replenish 100% of the water we use in places that need it most with the goal of delivering billions of gallons of water benefits over the next two decades. Through our Restore Fund, Apple has committed $200 million to nature-based carbon removal projects. And last month, we welcomed two supplier partners as new investors, who will together invest up to an additional $80 million in the fund. Whether we're enriching lives of users across the globe or doing our part to be a force for good in the world, we do everything with a deep sense of purpose at Apple. And I'm proud of the impact we've already made at the halfway point in a year of unprecedented innovation. I couldn't be more excited for the future we have ahead of us, driven by the imagination and innovation of our teams and the enduring importance of our products and services in people's lives. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $90.8 billion, down 4% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative year-over-year impact of 140 basis points on our results. Products revenue was $66.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to the challenging compare on iPhone that Tim described earlier, which was partially offset by strength from Mac. And thanks to our unparalleled customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers who are new to our products, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments. Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year with record performance in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.6%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings and favorable mix to services, partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 36.6%, down 280 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 74.6%, up 180 basis points from last quarter due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.4 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 5% year-over-year. Net income was $23.6 billion, diluted EPS was $1.53 and a March quarter record, and operating cash flow was strong at $22.7 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year, due to the almost $5 billion impact from a year ago that Tim described earlier. Adjusting for this one-time impact, iPhone revenue would be roughly flat to last year. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. And during the March quarter, we saw many iPhone models as the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, an iPhone was the top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, Australia, the U.K., France, Germany and Japan. And the iPhone 15 family continues to be very popular with customers. 451 Research recently measured customer satisfaction at 99% in the U.S. Mac revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our new MacBook Air, powered by the M3 chip. Customers are loving the incredible AI performance of the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. And our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of our MacBook Air buyers during the quarter being new to Mac. Also customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the U.S. iPad generated $5.6 billion in revenue, down 17% year-over-year. iPad continued to face a challenging compare against the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and iPad 10th Generation from last year. At the same time, the iPad installed base has continued to grow and is at an all-time high as over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. In addition, the latest reports from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for iPad in the US. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to a difficult launch compare. Last year, we had the continued benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro second-generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch installed base to a new all-time high and customer satisfaction was recently measured at 95% in the U.S. In services, as I mentioned, total revenue reached an all-time record of $23.9 billion, growing 14% year-over-year with our installed-base of active devices continuing to grow at a nice pace. This provides a strong foundation for the future growth of the services business as we continued to see increased customer engagement with our ecosystem. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. And paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over $1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. We continued to improve the breadth and quality of our current services from creating new games on Arcade and great new shows on TV+ to launching additional countries and partners for Apple Pay. Turning to enterprise, our customers continued to invest in Apple products to drive productivity and innovation. We see more and more enterprise customers embracing the Mac. In Healthcare, Epic Systems, the world's largest electronic medical record provider, recently launched its native app for the Mac, making it easier for healthcare organizations like Emory Health to transition thousands of PCs to the Mac for clinical use. And since the launch of Vision Pro last quarter, many leading enterprise customers have been investing in this amazing new product to bring spatial computing apps and experiences to life. We are seeing so many compelling use cases from aircraft engine maintenance training at KLM Airlines to real-time team collaboration for racing at Porsche to immersive kitchen design at Lowe's. We couldn't be more excited about the spatial computing opportunity in enterprise. Taking a quick step back, when we look at our performance during the first-half of our fiscal year, total company revenue was roughly flat to the prior year in spite of having one less week of sales during the period and some foreign exchange headwinds. We were particularly pleased with our strong momentum in emerging markets, as we set first-half revenue records in several countries and regions, including Latin-America, the Middle East, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Turkey. These results, coupled with double-digit growth in services and strong levels of gross margin, drove a first half diluted EPS record of $3.71, up 9% from last year. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $162 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $3.2 billion in maturing debt and commercial paper was unchanged sequentially, leaving us with total debt of $105 billion. As a result, net cash was $58 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.5 billion through open-market repurchases of $130 million Apple's shares. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, our Board has authorized today an additional $110 billion for share repurchases, as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash-neutral over time. We are also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.25 per share of common stock, and we continued to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward as we've done for the last 12 years. This cash dividend will be payable on May 16, 2024 to shareholders of record as of May 13, 2024. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect our June quarter total company revenue to grow low-single-digits year-over-year in spite of a foreign exchange headwind of about 2.5 percentage points. We expect our services business to grow double-digits at a rate similar to the growth we reported for the first-half of the fiscal year. And we expect iPad revenue to grow double-digits. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% to -- and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. With that, let's open the call to questions.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?
Operator: Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Mike Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I have two, first, I'll ask about the June quarter guidance. The revenue outlook for low-single digits growth, I was wondering if you could run through some of the product assumptions, iPhone, like what kind of gives you confidence around that? And then on the service momentum, what was better than expected in the quarter? And then I just have a quick follow-up.
Luca Maestri: Hey, Mike. It's Luca. On the outlook, what we said is we expect to grow low-single-digits in total for the company. We expect services to grow double-digits at a rate that is similar to what we've done in the first-half of our fiscal year. And we've also mentioned that iPad should grow double-digits. This is the color that we're providing for the June quarter. In services, we've seen a very strong performance across the board. We've mentioned, we've had records in several categories, in several geographic segments. It's very broad based, our subscription business is going well. Transacting accounts and paid accounts are growing double-digits. And also we've seen a really strong performance both in developed and emerging markets. So very pleased with the way the services business is going.
Mike Ng: Great. Thank you. And I wanted to ask about, as Apple leans more into AI and Generative AI, should we expect any changes to the historical CapEx cadence that we've seen in the last few years of about $10 billion to $11 billion per year or any changes to, you know, how we may have historically thought about the split between tooling, data center and facilities? Thank you very much.
Luca Maestri: Yes. We are obviously very excited about the opportunity with Gen AI. We obviously are pushing very hard on innovation on every front and we've been doing that for many, many years. Just during the last five years, we spent more than a $100 billion in research and development. As you know, on the CapEx front, we have a bit of a hybrid model where we make some of the investments ourselves. In other cases, we share them with our suppliers and partners on the manufacturing side, we purchased some of the tools and manufacturing equipment. In some of the cases, our suppliers make the investment. On the -- and we do something similar on the data center side. We have our own data center capacity and then we use capacity from third parties. It's a model that has worked well for us historically and we plan to continue along the same lines going forward.
Mike Ng: Excellent. Thank you very much.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Awesome. Thank you, Mike. Operator, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Tim, can you talk about the implications to Apple from the changes driven by EU DMA? You've had to open up third-party app stores, clearly disposes some security risks on the one-hand, which can dilute the experience, but also lower payments from developers to Apple. What are you seeing developers choose in these early days and consumers choose in terms of these third-party app stores? And I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook: It's really too early to answer the question. We just implemented in March, as you probably know, in the European Union, the alternate app stores and alternate billing, et cetera. So we're focused on complying while mitigating the impacts to user privacy and security that you mentioned. And so that's our focus.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you, Tim. And Luca, I was wondering if you could comment a bit on the product gross margins, the sequential step down. You noted both mix and leverage. Any more color on the mix, if you could share if customers are at all starting to mix down across product lines or is this more a mix across product lines? Just trying to get some color on customer behavior given some of the broader inflationary pressures. Thank you so much.
Luca Maestri: On a sequential basis, yes, we were down. It's primarily the fact that we had a slightly different mix of products than the previous one. Obviously, leverage plays a big role as we move from the holiday quarter into the -- into, you know, a more typical quarter. So I would say primarily leverage in a different mix of products. I mean, we haven't seen anything different in terms within the product categories, we haven't seen anything particular.
Wamsi Mohan: Thank you so much.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Wamsi. We'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe my first one, Tim, you've obviously mentioned your excitement around Generative AI multiple times. I'm just curious how Apple is thinking about the different ways in which you can monetize this technology because historically software upgrades haven't been a big factor in driving product cycles. And so could AI be potentially different? And how could that impact replacement cycles? Is there any services angle you'd be thinking? Any early color that you can share on that? And then I have a follow up, please. Thanks.
Tim Cook: I don't want to get in front of our announcements, obviously. I would just say that we see Generative AI as a very key opportunity across our products. And we believe that we have advantages that set us apart there. And we'll be talking more about it in as we go through the weeks ahead.
Erik Woodring: Okay. Very fair. Thank you. And then Luca, maybe to just follow up on Wamsi's comments or question. There's a broad concern about the headwind that rising commodity costs have on your product gross margins. Wondering if you could just clarify for us if we take a step back and look at all of the components and commodities that go into your products kind of collectively, are we -- are you seeing these costs rising? Are they falling? What tools do you have to try to help and mitigate some rising costs if at all, rising input costs if at all? Thank you so much.
Luca Maestri: Yes. I mean during the last quarter, commodity costs, and in general, component costs have behaved favorably to us. On the memory front, prices are starting to go up. They've gone up slightly during the March quarter. But in general, I think it's been a period not only this quarter, but the last several quarters where, you know, commodities have behaved well for us. Commodities going cycles and so there's obviously always that possibility. Keep in mind that we are starting from a very high level of gross margins. We reported 46.6%, which is something that we haven't seen in our company in decades. And so we're starting from a good point. As you know, we try to buy ahead when the cycles are favorable to us. And so we will try to mitigate if there are headwinds. But in general, we feel particularly for this cycle, we are in good shape.
Erik Woodring: Thank you so much.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Great. Thank you, Erik. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.
Ben Reitzes: Hey, thanks for the question. And hey, Tim, I was wondering if I could ask the China question again. Is there any more color from your visit there that gives you confidence that you've reached a bottom there and that it's turning? And I know you've been -- you've continued to be confident there in the long-term. Just wondering if there was any color as to when you think that the tide turns there? Thanks a lot. And I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook: Yes, Ben, if you look at our results in Q2 for Greater China, we were down 8%. That's an acceleration from the previous quarter in Q1. And the primary driver of the acceleration was iPhone. And if you then look at iPhone within Mainland China, we grew on a reported basis. That's before any kind of normalization for the supply disruption that we mentioned earlier. And if you look at the top-selling smartphones, the Top 2 in Urban China are iPhones. And while I was there, it was a great visit and we opened a new store in Shanghai and the reception was very warm and highly energetic, and so I left there having a fantastic trip and enjoyed being there. And so I maintain a great view of China in the long-term. I don't know how each and every quarter goes and each and every week. But over the long haul, I have a very positive viewpoint.
Ben Reitzes: Okay. Hey, thanks, Tim. And then my follow-up, I want to ask this carefully though. It's a -- there's a fear out there that, you may lose some traffic acquisition revenue. And I was wondering if you thought AI from big picture and it doesn't have to be on a long-term basis, I mean from a big picture, if AI is an opportunity for you to continue to monetize your mobile real estate, just how you -- how maybe investors can think about that from a big picture, just given that's been one of the concerns that's potentially been an overhang, of course, due to, you know, a lot of the news and the media around some of the legal cases? And I was wondering if there's just a big-picture color you could give that makes us kind of think about it better and your ability to sort of continue to monetize that real estate? Thanks a lot.
Tim Cook: I think AI, Generative AI and AI, both are big opportunities for us across our products. And we'll talk more about it in the coming weeks. I think there are numerous ways there that are great for us. And we think that we're well-positioned.
Ben Reitzes: Thanks, Tim.
Tim Cook: Yes.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Again, sorry to beat the AI haul. But Tim, I know you don't want to like reveal a lot. But I'm just kind of curious, because last quarter you spoke about how you're getting traction in enterprise. Is the AI strategy going to be both consumer and enterprise or is it going to be one after the other? Any color would be helpful? And then, I have a follow-up for Luca.
Tim Cook: Our focus on enterprise has been and you know through the quarter and the quarters that preceded it on selling iPhones and iPads and Macs and we recently added Vision Pro to that. And we're thrilled with what we see there in terms of interest from big companies buying some to explore ways they can use it. And so I see enormous opportunity in the enterprise. I wouldn't want to cabin that to AI only. I think there's a great opportunity for us around the world in the enterprise.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful. And then for Luca, you know, I'm kind of curious on -- given the macro-environment, on the hardware side, are you seeing a bias towards like standard iPhone versus the Pro model? The reason I'm asking the question is that there's a weaker consumer spending environment, yet your services business is still growing and has amazing gross margins. So I'm just trying to like square the circle over there. Thank you.
Luca Maestri: I'm not sure I fully understand the question, but in general, what we are seeing on the product side, we continued to see a lot of interest at the top of the range of our products. And I think it's a combination of consumers wanting to purchase the best product that we offer in the different categories and our ability to make those purchases more affordable over time. We've introduced several financing solutions from installment plans to trading programs that reduce the affordability threshold and therefore, customers tend to buy -- want to buy at the top of the range that is very valuable for us in developed markets, but particularly in emerging markets where the affordability issues are more pronounced. But in general, over the last several years and that is also reflected in our gross margins, over the last several years, we've seen this trend, which we think is pretty sustainable.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Thank you very much, Luca, and thanks, Tim.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish. Operator, we'll have the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. You know, I guess, first off on capital allocation, you folks have about $58 billion of net cash right now. As you think about eventually getting to this net cash-neutral target, do you think at some point, Apple would be open to taking on leverage on the balance sheet and continuing the buyback program? Or is it more like once you get to this neutral position, it's going to be about returning free cash flow back to shareholders? I'm just wondering, how do you think about leverage on your balance sheet over time and what sort of leverage do you think you'd be comfortable taking on?
Luca Maestri: Hey, Amit. This is Luca. I would say one step at a time, we have put out this target of getting to net cash-neutral several years ago and we're working very hard to get there. Our free cash flow generation has been very strong over the years, particularly in the last few years. And so as you've seen this year, we've increased the amount that we're allocating to the buyback. For the last couple of years, we were doing $90 billion, now we're doing $110 billion. So let's get there first. It's going to take a while still. And then when we are there, we're going to reassess and see what is the optimal capital structure for the company at that point in time. Obviously, there's going to be a number of considerations that we will need to look at when we get there.
Amit Daryanani: Fair enough. I figure it's worth trying anyway. If I go back to this China discussion a bit and, you know, Tim, I think your comments around growth in iPhones in Mainland China is really notable. Could you step back, I mean, these numbers are still declining at least Greater China on a year-over-year basis in aggregate. Maybe just talk about what are you seeing from a macro basis in China and then at least annual decline -- or year-over-year declines that we're seeing. Do you think it's more macro driven or more competitive driven over there? That would be helpful.
Tim Cook: Yes, I can only tell you what we're seeing. And so I don't want to present myself as a economist. So I'll steer clear of that. From what we saw was an acceleration from Q1, and it was driven by iPhone and iPhone in Mainland China before we adjust for this $5 billion impact that we talked about earlier did grow. That means the other products didn't fare as well. And so we clearly have work there to do. I think it has been and is through last quarter, the most competitive market in the world. And I -- so I, you know, wouldn't say anything other than that. I've said that before, and I believe that it was last quarter as well. And -- but if you step back from the 90-day cycle, what I see is a lot of people moving into the middle class, a -- we try to serve customers very well there and have a lot of happy customers and you can kind of see that in the latest store opening over there. And so I continue to feel very optimistic.
Amit Daryanani: Great. Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Amit. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Vogt: Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. I'm going to roll the two together, so you guys have them both. So Luca obviously, I'm trying to parse through the outlook for the June quarter. And just based on the quick math, it looks like all things being equal, given what you said, the iPhone business is going to be down mid-single-digits again in the June quarter. And if that's the case and maybe this is for Tim obviously, how are you thinking about the competitive landscape in the context of what you just said maybe outside of China and what changes sort of, the consumer demand or receptivity to new devices because we've been in this malaise for a while. Is it really this AI initiative that a lot of companies are pursuing? And do you think that changes sort of the demand drivers going forward? Or is it just really more of a timing issue in terms of the replacement cycle is a little bit long in the tooth, and we see a bit of an upgrade cycle at some point, maybe later this year into next year? Thanks.
Tim Cook: I do see a key opportunity, as I've mentioned before with Generative AI with all of our devices or the vast majority of our devices. And so I think that if you look out that that's not within the next quarter or so and we don't guide at the product level, but I'm extremely optimistic. And so that -- that's kind of how I view it. In terms of the -- I'll let Luca comment on the outlook portion of it. I think if you step back on iPhone though and you make this adjustment from the previous year, our Q2 results would be flattish on iPhone. And so that's how we performed in Q2.
Luca Maestri: Yes, David, on the outlook, I'll only repeat what we said before, and this is the color that we're providing for the quarter. We do expect to grow in total, low-single-digits. And we do expect services to grow double-digits, and we expect iPad to grow double-digits for the rest. I'll let you make assumptions and then we will report three months from now.
David Vogt: Great. Thanks guys. I'll get back in the queue.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, David. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my question, and I have a couple as well. Maybe for the first one, your services growth accelerated from 11% growth to 14%. If you can sort of dig into the drivers of where or which parts of services did you really see that acceleration? And why it isn't a bit more sustainable as we think about the next quarter? Because I believe you're guiding more to sort of averaging out the first half of the year for the next quarter. So just curious what were the drivers and why not have it a bit more sustainably sort of improve as we go through the remainder of the year? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.
Luca Maestri: So a number of things on services. First of all, the overall performance was very strong. As I said earlier, all-time records in both developed and emerging markets. So we see our services do well across the world. Records in many of our services categories. There are some categories that are growing very fast also because they are relatively smaller in the scheme of our services business like cloud, video, payment services. You know, those all set all-time revenue records. And so we feel very good about the progress that we're making in services. As we go forward, I'll just point out that if you look at our growth rates a year ago, they improved during the course of the fiscal year last year. So the comps for the services business become a bit more challenging as we go through the year. But in general, as I mentioned, we still expect to grow double-digits in the June quarter at a rate that is very similar to what we've done in the first half.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. Got it. And for my follow up, if I can ask you more specifically about the India market. Obviously, you continue to make new records in terms of revenue in that market. How much of the momentum you're seeing would you associate with your sort of retail strategy in that market, retail expansion relative to maybe some of the supply change or the sort of manufacturing changes or strategy you've undergone or taken in that market itself. Any thoughts around that would be helpful?
Tim Cook: Sure. We did grow strong double-digit. And so we were very, very pleased about it. It was a new March quarter revenue record for us. As you know, as I've said before, I see it as an incredibly exciting market and it's a major focus for us. In terms of the operational side or supply chain side, we are producing there, from a pragmatic point of view, you need to produce there to be competitive. And so yes, there the two things are linked from that point of view. But we have both operational things going on and we have go-to-market, and initiatives going on. We just opened a couple of stores as last year, as you know, and we see enormous opportunity there. We're continuing to expand our channels, and also working on the developer ecosystem as well. And we've been very pleased that there is a rapidly-growing base of developers there. And so, we're working all of the entire ecosystem from developer to the market to operations, the whole thing. And I just -- I could not be more excited and enthusiastic about it.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. Thank you. Thanks for that.
Tim Cook: Yes.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Samik. Operator, we'll have the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the questions, and I think I have to have two as well like everybody else. I guess, I'm going to go back to the China question. I guess, at a high level, the simple question is, when we look at the data points that have been repeatedly reported throughout the course of this quarter, I'm curious, Tim, you know, what are we missing? Like where do you think people are missing, Apple's iPhone traction within the China market, just at a high level, you know, given the data points that were reported throughout this course of the last quarter?
Tim Cook: I can't address the data points. I can only address what our results are. And we did accelerate last quarter, and the iPhone grew in Mainland China. So that's what the results were. I can't bridge to numbers we didn't come up with.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, I know you guys haven't talked about this, you know, quantified it in quite some time. But I'm curious how we would characterize the channel inventory dynamics for iPhone?
Tim Cook: Sure. The -- for the March quarter, we decreased channel inventory during the quarter. We usually decreased channel inventory during the Q2 timeframe. So that's not unusual. And we're very comfortable with the overall channel inventory.
Aaron Rakers: Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Aaron. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.
Richard Kramer: Thanks very much. I'm not going to ask about China, but you regularly call out all the rapid growth in many other emerging markets. So is Apple approaching a point where all of those other emerging markets in aggregate might crossover to become larger than your current $70 billion Greater China segments, and maybe investors could look at that for driving growth for the wider business? And then I have a follow-up for Luca. Thanks.
Luca Maestri: I think, Richard, you're asking a really interesting question. We were looking at something similar recently. Obviously, China is by far the largest emerging market that we have. But when we started looking at places like India, like Saudi, like Mexico, Turkey, of course, Brazil and Mexico and Indonesia, the numbers are getting large, and we're very happy because these are markets where our market share is low, the populations are large and growing. And our products are really making a lot of progress with the -- in those markets. The level of excitement for the brand is very high. Tim was in Southeast Asia recently, and the level of excitement is incredibly high. So it is very good for us. And then -- and certainly, the numbers are getting larger all the time. And so the gap as you compare it to the numbers in China is reducing, and hopefully, that trajectory continues for a long time.
Richard Kramer: Okay. And then as a follow-up, maybe for either of you, I mean, you're coming up on four years from what was incredibly popular iPhone 12 cycle. And, you know, given you're struggling to reduce your net -- your -- reach your net neutral cash position and your margins are sort of near highs, do you see ways to deploy capital more to spur replacement demand in your installed base either with greater device financing, more investment in marketing, more promotions. I mean, do you feel like you needed to produce those sort of margins or is it a more important to spur growth with replacement? Thanks.
Tim Cook: I think innovation spurs the upgrade cycle, and as one thing, of course, there's economic factors as well that play in there. And what kind of offerings there are from our carrier partners and so forth. And so there's a number of variables in there. But we work all of those, and you know, we price our products for the value that we're delivering. And so that's how we look at it.
Luca Maestri: And if I can add to Tim's comments, Richard, one of the things that when you look over the long arc of time that maybe is not fully understood is that we've gone through a long period of very strong dollar. And what that means given that our company sells more than 60% of our revenue is outside the United States. The demand for our products in those markets is stronger than the results that we report just because of the translation of those local currencies into dollars, right? And so that is something to keep in mind as you look at our results, right? And so we are making all the investments that are needed and Tim has talked about innovation. Obviously, we made a lot of progress with financing solutions, with trading programs and so on, and we will continue to make all those investments.
Richard Kramer: Okay. Super. Thanks, guys.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. Operator, can we take our last question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.
Atif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions, and I have two questions as well. First for Tim, for enterprise, specifically, what are some of the top two or three use cases on Vision Pro you're hearing most excitement? And then I have a follow-up for Luca.
Tim Cook: Yes, the great thing is, I'm hearing about so many of them. I wouldn't say that one has emerged as the top, right now. The most impressive thing is that similar to the way people use a Mac, you use it for everything. People are using it for many different things in enterprise, and that varies from field service to training to healthcare related things like preparing a doctor for pre-op surgery or advanced imaging. And so the -- it commands control centers. And so it's an enormous number of different verticals. And you know our focus is on -- is growing that ecosystem and getting more apps and more and more enterprises engaged. And the event that we had recently, I can't overstate the enthusiasm in the room. It was extraordinary. And so we're off to a good start, I think, with the enterprise.
Atif Malik: Great. And then Luca, I believe you mentioned that for the March quarter, the commodity pricing environment was favorable. Can you talk about what you're assuming for commodity pricing on memory and et cetera for the June quarter and maybe for the full-year?
Luca Maestri: Yes, we provide guidance just for the current quarter. So I'll tell you about the, you know, the guidance. We're guiding to again to a very high level of gross margins, 45.5% to 46.5%. Within that guidance, we expect memory to be a slight headwind, not a very large one, but a slight headwind. And the same applies for foreign exchange. Foreign exchange will have a negative impact sequentially of about 30 basis points.
Atif Malik: Thank you.

2024,Q3,2024-08-01,"Suhasini Chandramouli: Good afternoon and welcome to the Apple Q3 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today is Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Tim Cook : Thank you Suhasini. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% from a year ago and better than we had expected. EPS grew double digits to $1.40 and achieved a record for the June quarter. We also set quarterly revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. And we set an all-time revenue record in services which grew 14%. At our Worldwide Developers Conference, we were thrilled to unveil game-changing updates across our platforms, including Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovation and investment in AI and Machine Learning. It will transform how users interact with technology, from writing tools to help you express yourself, to image playground, which gives you the ability to create fun images and communicate in new ways, to powerful tools for summarizing and prioritizing notifications. Siri also becomes more natural, more useful, and more personal than ever. Apple Intelligence is built on a foundation of privacy, both through on-device processing that does not collect users' data and through private cloud compute, a groundbreaking new approach to using the cloud, while protecting users' information powered by Apple silicon. We are also integrating ChatGPT into experiences within iPhone, Mac, and iPad, enabling users to draw on a broad base of world knowledge. We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and we remain incredibly optimistic about the extraordinary possibilities of AI and its ability to enrich customers' lives. We will continue to make significant investments in this technology and dedicate ourselves to the innovation that will unlock its full potential. Recently, we've also been excited to bring Apple Vision Pro to more countries, giving customers the chance to discover the remarkable capabilities of this magical device. Vision Pro users are customizing their own workspaces, watching movies on 100-foot screens, and exploring entire worlds with just a pinch of their fingertips. With more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for Vision OS, the developer community continues to pioneer stunning spatial experiences that are only possible with Vision Pro. Last month, we announced that we're bringing some amazing new immersive content to Vision Pro, including new series, concerts, films, and more. And we've seen great interest for Vision Pro in the enterprise, where it can empower companies large and small to pursue their best ideas like never before. With each innovation, we're unlocking new ways of working, new ways of learning, and new ways of tapping into the unlimited promise of human potential. We are doing that across every product and every service. Now let me share more detail in our June quarter results, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to last year. Customers continue to praise the iPhone 15 lineup for its incredible battery life, exceptional cameras, and unmatched power and performance. And we are excited to bring incredible new features to the iPhone with iOS 18, making it more personal, capable, and intelligent than ever before. This update includes the biggest redesign of the Photos app, new customization options for the home screen, messages over satellite, and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence utilizes the power of our most advanced iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, offering a transformative set of capabilities. Mac revenue was $7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Customers are loving the latest M3-powered 13 and 15 inch MacBook Air. With back-to-school season upon us, MacBook Air is the perfect companion for students on campus and small business owners, developers, and creatives of all kinds depend on Mac to do more than they ever could before. Powered by Apple silicon with its neural engine and privacy built in at the chip level, Macs are simply the best personal computers for AI. And every Mac we've shipped with Apple silicon since 2020, is capable of taking advantage of Apple Intelligence with Mac OS Sequoia. We also know the importance of security for our users and enterprises so we continue to advance protections across our products. Turning to iPad, revenue was $7.2 billion, 24% higher year-over-year. During the quarter, we had an incredible launch where we unveiled the all-new 11 and 13 inch iPad Air, the perfect device for education, entertainment, and so much more. And With the new iPad Pro, we pushed the boundaries of power-efficient performance with the remarkable M4 chip, the engine behind this incredibly thin device. By leveraging the latest in Apple silicon, Video Editors and Musicians can take advantage of the cutting edge AI features in Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro. And we're very excited that iPad Pro and iPad Air models powered by the M series of Apple silicon will be able to utilize the powerful capabilities of Apple Intelligence. In wearables, home, and accessories, revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% from a year ago. Apple Watch is empowering users to live a healthier day with a range of tools to take charge of their wellness journeys. At the core of Apple Watch, are powerful AI features that are helping users get help when they need it most, from irregular heart rhythm notifications to walking steadiness to crash detection and fall detection. I've heard time and again how meaningful these features are for users and their loved ones, and their stories motivate us to keep pushing forward on this vital work. As I mentioned earlier, in services, we set an all-time revenue record of $24.2 billion with paid subscriptions climbing to an all-time high. We achieve revenue records in the majority of the services categories with all-time revenue records in advertising, cloud, and payment services. Apple TV+ productions are delighting audiences on screens large and small. We're sharing powerful works of imagination with series and movies like Presumed Innocent, the Upcoming Disclaimer, and The Instigators starring Matt Damon. And we can't wait for returning fan favorites with new seasons of The Morning Show, Slow Horses, and Severance. Apple TV+ productions also continue to earn accolades with nearly 2,300 nominations and 500 wins to-date. That includes 72 Emmy Award nominations across 16 programs our best ever showing for the upcoming awards event. During the quarter, we also expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets including Japan, Canada, Italy, and Germany, enabling more businesses to use the power of iPhone to accept contactless payments. And we announced new updates to our services coming this fall, including US national park hikes and custom walk routes and Apple Maps, the ability to pay with rewards using Apple Pay, collaborative listening with Apple Music, and a redesigned Apple Fitness+ experience to help users make the most of our library of workouts and meditations. Turning to retail, we continue to expand in emerging markets with our first ever location in Malaysia. Customers from all over the country came together with our team members to celebrate this special moment. Elsewhere in the world, our teams have been sharing the magic of Apple Vision Pro and demos that delight, inspire, and deeply move customers exploring the wonders of spatial computing for the first time. At the heart of all of our innovations are the values that guide everything we do. We believe fundamentally that the best technology is technology that works for everyone. And in honor of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we introduced all new capabilities to give users more ways to take advantage of all our products can do. These include eye tracking for users to control iPhone or iPad visually, music haptics to give those who are deaf or hard of hearing a tangible way to experience music, and vocal shortcuts that tie task to a user's voice. And we are committed as ever to shipping products that offer the highest standards of privacy for our users. With everything we do, whether it's offering a browser like Safari that prevents third-parties from tracking you across the internet or providing new features like the ability to lock and hide apps, we are determined to keep our users in control of their own data. And we are just as dedicated to ensuring the security of our users' data. That's why we work to minimize the amount of data we collect and work to maximize how much is processed directly on people's devices, a foundational principle that is at the core of all we build, including Apple Intelligence. And we continue to make significant progress on the environment. We are proud to say that all of our data centers, including those that will run private cloud compute, operate on 100% renewable energy. At Apple, we're constantly accelerating our pace of innovation. We are a company in relentless pursuit of big ideas. Time and again, we've seen how a spark of creativity can reach breakthrough velocity, reach across previously unexplored dimensions, and ultimately take flight in ways that can change the world. It's why we're going to keep investing in the meaningful innovation that enriches the lives of all of our customers. We have a busy time ahead of us, and I couldn't be more excited for all the amazing things yet to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.
Luca Maestri : Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, despite 230 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact. We achieved growth in the vast majority of our markets, with June quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $61.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to our unmatched levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with an all-time record in developed markets and a June quarter record in emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.3% near the high end of our guidance range and down 30 basis points sequentially driven by a different mix within products which was partially offset by a favorable mix shift towards services and cost savings. Products gross margin was 35.3%, down 130 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 74% down 60 basis points from last quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided and up 7% year-over-year. Net income was $21.4 billion, diluted EPS of $1.40 was up 11% year-over-year and set a June quarter record. And operating cash flow was very strong at $28.9 billion, also a June quarter record. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year, but grew on a constant currency basis. We set June quarter records across several countries, including the UK, Spain, Poland, Mexico, Indonesia, and the Philippines. And the iPhone Active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the June quarter, many iPhone models were among the top selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top selling model in the US, urban China, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. Customer satisfaction on the iPhone 15 family continues to be extremely high, with 451 Research measuring it at 98% in the US in their latest reports. Mac generated $7 billion in revenue, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the MacBook Air powered by the M3 chip. We saw particularly strong performance in our emerging markets, with June quarter records for Mac in Latin America, India, and South Asia. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of MacBook Air customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the US. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, up 24% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Customers are loving the latest iPad lineup for its new design and display, unparalleled performance, AI capabilities and much more. The iPad install base has continued to grow and is an all-time high, as half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the US. Wearables, home and accessories revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year, a sequential acceleration from the March quarter. Watch and AirPods continue to face a difficult compare against prior year launches of the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch install base to a new all-time high. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicate a customer satisfaction of 97% for watch in the US. In services, total revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year. We continue to have great momentum in services, as the growth of our installed base of active devices, sets a strong foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. And we see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reach a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Also, paid subscriptions showed strong double digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. And we are constantly focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services. From critically acclaimed new content on Apple TV+ to new games on Apple Arcade and the many latest features we previewed during WWDC for iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Cash, Apple Music, and more. Turning to enterprise, we continue to see businesses, leveraging our entire suite of products to drive productivity and creativity for their teams and customers. USAA, a leading insurance and financial services company, recently expanded beyond their existing iPhone and iPad deployments to provide their employees with the latest MacBook Air. And American Express has continued to add to their fleet of over 10,000 Macs to enhance their employees' productivity, security, and collaboration. We're also excited to see leading organizations such as Boston Children's Hospital and Lufthansa using Apple Vision Pro to build innovative spatial computing experiences to transform the training of their workforces. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $153 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $4.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of $101 billion. As a result, net cash was $52 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $32 billion to shareholders, including $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $26 billion through open market repurchases of 139 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect foreign exchange to continue to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. We expect our September quarter total company revenue to grow year-over-year at a rate similar to the June quarter. We expect services revenue to grow double digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the first three quarters of this fiscal year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.2 billion and $14.4 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16.5%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on August 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of August 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.
Suhasini Chandramouli : Thank you Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?
Operator: Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erik Woodring: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe Tim, if we start with you, you know, I thought some of the color you provided before the call about iPhone 15 performing better than the iPhone 14 was interesting. So just with that context, can you maybe help us understand where you see iPhone replacement cycles today, where you think the size of the base of iPhones that are aged and likely to upgrade are, and what that translates to in potential pent-up demand, as we enter a new iPhone cycle. And I have a follow-up, thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes, hi Eric. The installed base hit an all-time high during the quarter and so we were very happy about that. iPhone in general grew in constant currency. And the 15, as you point out, if you look at the same number of weeks of the 15 from launch and compare that to the 14, the 15 is doing better than the 14. And so that's kind of a state of where we currently are. In terms of upgrade rates, it's very difficult mid-cycle to call upgrade rates. I would just say that with Apple Intelligence, we are very excited about the level of value that we're going to provide to users. And we believe that -- that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade.
Erik Woodring: Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks, Tim. And then second, can you maybe dig into the China dynamics a bit? Sales down 6% this quarter, 3% in constant currency, an improvement from last quarter on a tougher compare that came on the back of some iPhone discounting. So can you maybe just share color on the China market as a whole how much you believe promotions helped in the quarter, how sustainable this improvement is, and if this performance really changes any of your approach to the China market as we look forward. Thanks so much.
Tim Cook: Yeah, Erik, as you point out, we decreased by 6.5% year-over-year for the whole of Greater China. And if you look at it on a constant currency basis, we declined by less than 3%. So over 50% of the decline year-over-year is currency related. That is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year, and so we're happy to see the acceleration. If you look at iPhone in particular for Greater China, the installed base set a record. We also in Mainland China set a June quarter record for upgraders and so that's a very strong signal and in fact from Kantar -- the survey from Kantar this quarter showed that iPhones were the top three models in urban China. Also, if you look at -- one of the things we look at is the 15 family compared to the 14 family for the same number of weeks from launch. So this goes all the way back to the September of 2023. If you look at that, the 15 is outperforming the 14. And so those are some of the color I would provide. In addition, one of the things that we're very focused on is the level of new customers buying our products. And so if you look at this on the Mac and iPad, in Mainland China, the majority of customers buying or buying for the first time, buying that product for the first time and the watch, the vast, vast majority of people are buying a product for the first time. And during the quarter, I should say also that iPad returned to growth in Greater China, as it did around the world. And so we continue to be confident in the long-term opportunity in China. I don't know how every chapter of the book reads, but we're very confident in the long-term.
Erik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much.
Tim Cook: Yeah.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Erik. Operator, may we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.
Ben Reitzes: Hey, thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Hey, Tim, you know, now that you've launched or announced Apple intelligence, do you have any ideas on how it may impact services. Would it – do you feel like it'll accelerate your Services business augmented? And maybe folks will need to buy more storage and some other things. How are you thinking about it as a catalyst for Services into next year? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Tim Cook: We started the rollout of Apple Intelligence this week with developers, so some of the features are out there as of Monday. And we couldn't be more excited about getting them out there. Obviously, this will enable developers to take their apps to the next level. And so we are taking the first step in getting the beta out there, and we can't wait to see what kind of amazing things they do with it.
Ben Reitzes: Okay. Thanks. And then Luca, with regard to gross margin, it's been -- there's been some component price inflation and mix. Do you mind just giving us a little more color on how you are managing that sequentially and how you feel about the current component environment as an impact on margins? Thanks.
Luca Maestri: Sure, Ben. I think I'll give you a bit of the walk for the June quarter and then get into the outlook that we provided for the September quarter. At the total company level, we've reported 46.3%. It is down 30 basis points sequentially, and it was really driven by a different mix. Within products, of course, we launched very important products like the iPad during the course of the quarter. But we had an offset from a shift in mix towards Services, and we got some good cost savings. And so when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, we are up significantly on the margin front. And keep in mind that foreign exchange continues to be a bit of a headwind for us. As we go into the September quarter, we are guiding 45.5% to 46.5%, which is kind of within the guidance that we provided last quarter. Again similar dynamics, we expect a slightly different mix. We expect foreign exchange to have a minimal impact sequentially, although a more significant impact on a year-over-year basis. On the commodity side, I think that is what you are referring to, yes we have seen some increases on the memory front, but the rest of the commodities, we see a continuous decline. So in general, we feel -- we're well positioned. And as you know well, these are very high levels of gross margin for us and we are pleased where we are.
Ben Reitzes: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Ben. Operator may we have the next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Mike Ng: Hi, good afternoon. I just have two questions. First, I was wondering if you could talk about whether or not you've seen a shift in demand for iPhone 15 Pro, Pro Max models since WWDC that could potentially foreshadow consumer demand for Apple Intelligence enabled phones?
Tim Cook: We just announced the sort of the requirements at the system and the silicon level in June. And so we had very limited time during the quarter. So it's really too early to tell.
Mike Ng: That's fair. And then with the focus on upgrader potential over the next several years, I was just wondering if you could talk about what you are expecting from the US promotional environment from your channel partners, whether that's US wireless carriers, given the importance of device sales for those partners during an upgrade cycle. Or any retail support on what could be a very strong smartphone upgrade period? Thank you.
Tim Cook: We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and what it brings, and it is another compelling reason for an upgrade. I'd leave the promotional question for the sort of the carriers themselves to answer. But I believe it will be a very key time for -- and a compelling upgrade cycle.
Mike Ng: Great. Thank you Tim.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Mike. Operator, can we have the next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani: Good afternoon everyone. And I have two as well. I guess, Tim, maybe back to the Apple Intelligence dynamic. There's clearly a lot of excitement from consumers around what Apple Intelligence could mean for them. Can you just touch on your -- do you think the intent is to launch all the Apple Intelligence features at the same time to consumers, or do you think they end up getting staggered a bit? And if they are staggered, do you think it impacts how consumers come out and buy the next-generation iPhone?
Tim Cook: The rollout, as we mentioned in June, sort of -- we've actually started with developers this week. We started with some features of Apple Intelligence, not the complete suite. There are other features like languages beyond US English that will happen over the course of the year, and there are other features that will happen over the course of the year. And ChatGPT is integrated by the end of the calendar year. And so yes, so it’s a staggered launch.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. And then I guess your Services growth rates have been extremely impressive for several quarters and it seems like it is accelerated recently. Can you just touch -- talk about when you look at this double-digit growth, how much of that do you think is coming from the installed base growth versus better ARPU or better monetization of the installed base? And how do you kind of see that mix changing as you go forward?
Luca Maestri: Yes, Amit, it is Luca. It's a combination of a number of factors. The installed base growth is very important of course, because we have a larger pool of customers that uses the ecosystem and uses our Services. We are seeing and we've seen this consistently for many, many quarters now. We see continued growth in the level of engagement that our customers have with our ecosystem. We have more transacting accounts every quarter, so more people using the ecosystem both the free elements of the ecosystem and the paid elements. We see paid accounts growing double digits, and we've seen that for many, many quarters. Now we look at our paid subscriptions on our platform, and they are growing strong double digits as well. So obviously, the growing level of engagement helps us both from an ARPU standpoint and just a volume standpoint. Obviously, as you've seen over the last several years, we launched new services over time, and we've launched many new services, fairly recently. Obviously, our payments business is relatively new, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Fitness+, so many other services we've added. And so we are providing more and more opportunities for our customers to interact with the ecosystem. And we believe we are doing also a very good job at improving the quality of these services and improving the amount of content that we make available. We continue to make significant investments on TV+, on Apple Arcade. We are launching new shows, new games all the time. And I think you will continue to see that as we go forward. We are very, very happy with the 14% growth that we had this quarter because, particularly if you look at the performance that we had in Services a year ago, the compares for us tend to get a bit more challenging in the second half of our fiscal year. But in spite of that, we delivered a level of growth that was better than what we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Amit. Operator we will take the next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. Tim, you announced Apple Intelligence, but you also announced partnerships with OpenAI and presumably more coming down the road. How should investors think about the monetization models around these partnerships where the CapEx investments are clearly being made by these potential partners. But you're obviously -- they're leveraging your distribution to your very attractive installed base. So in the long-term, do you see the Apple Intelligence part -- the Services growth from Apple Intelligence being the larger contributor over time? Or do you see these partnerships becoming a larger contributor over time? And I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook: I think the way that I look at it is that Apple Intelligence is the on-device processing and the Private Cloud Compute. And a lot of that will be things with a personal context. And then for world knowledge, we are integrating with ChatGPT initially, and that will be focused on world knowledge as I said. And so the monetization model, I don't want to get into the terms of the commercial agreements because they are confidential between the parties. But I see both aspects as being very important. People want both.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks. As a follow-up maybe for Luca. Just stepping back to the gross margin discussion again. If I look at calendar 2023, you had on average 150 basis points increase in product gross margins on a year-on-year basis. In 2024 so far, it had been more flat year-on-year. When we think about that, is the incremental headwind, I mean there was FX headwinds throughout the last several years. So ex-FX, are there other incremental headwinds that are either temporary or structural in nature that are perhaps limiting further upside to what are obviously very strong gross margins? Thank you.
Luca Maestri: Yes. Of course, as you said, the foreign exchange continues to be -- this is incremental on a year-over-year basis. And it is one of those things that is outside of our control. We try to hedge our exposures. But it is what it is. We know that when the dollar is strong, our gross margins are affected. The other element that I think it's always important to keep in mind is that within the Products business, our products have different margin profiles. And depending on the relative success in the marketplace, our products' gross margin tends to move. And so the mix of our products has an impact on gross margins, right? And so we need to pay attention to that. Of course, we just launched an iPad and that is one of the factors. But we want all our products to be very successful in the marketplace. And that's why we always look at gross margin dollars as the first order of priority, and gross margin percentage tends to follow from that. The other factor that obviously has an impact, a significant impact is the state of the commodity markets, and they tend to go in cycles. And so we will see how that plays out over time. But in general, we feel good about the level of gross margins that we have for our products business, and we think we are in a good position there.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Wamsi. Operator, can we have the next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the strong results. The first one for Luca or Tim. We keep hearing about these increasing silicon content for AI edge devices. And also, I think, Luca you spoke about increasing commodity costs. So I'm curious how to think about margins for these new AI devices. And Tim, do any of these Apple Intelligence features need more hardware updates than what we have today? And then I have a quick follow-up.
Tim Cook: Maybe I'll take the second one first and then pass it over to Luca. In terms of the requirements to run Apple Intelligence, there are system requirements and there are silicon requirements. And so from an iPhone point of view, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will run Apple Intelligence and the successor products obviously. If you look at the Mac, it starts with the M series of silicon that started in 2020. And the iPad is the same, and so it starts with the M series of silicon. And so there are system requirements and silicon requirements that go with each of those.
Luca Maestri: And from a gross margin standpoint, as you know, we don't provide any color past the current quarter, and we just provided guidance for the quarter 45.5% to 46.5%. It is essentially broadly in line with what we reported for the June quarter. So we'll take it quarter by quarter and we will report as the time goes by.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up for Tim. Thanks for the color on China. We also see many other consumer discretionary and luxury brands talk about a weak China. And I think Tim, you said half the details was FX related. I'm curious, the other half of the weakness, was that more China macro related or do you think it is kind of like specific to Apple with domestic competitors? Any other color you could give would be very helpful. Thank you very much.
Tim Cook: Well, certainly, the competitive environment there is the most competitive in the world. I've said that before and that remains to be the case. The macroeconomic factors have been in the press too, and I'm not an expert on those. I can only tell you what we're seeing. And we were pleased that the business showed improvement from the first half of the year.
Krish Sankar: Thanks Tim.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Krish. Operator, can we have the next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Vogt: Great. Two, if I may also. Tim, first one for you. I know it is early days, and you talked about the developers just getting their hands on Apple Intelligence. But when you think about the categories that are currently in the App Store and kind of what you think app developers could do with this new technology, what's your instinct say in terms of -- are these going to be iterative applications to currently available applications? Is there any sort of category that you think lends itself more naturally to Apple Intelligence? Is it games? Is it more creative? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about it. And then I have a follow-up for Luca. Thanks.
Tim Cook: If you look at how we've deployed Apple Intelligence or are deploying Apple Intelligence, we've really thought about it at pretty much all of the apps that you use every day. And so we've thought about it from Notes to Mail to Messages and all the rest. And so there is been a deep level of thinking about how it affects those apps. And that's going to surface Apple Intelligence in a way that is natural to the user, in a way that will I think, get them very excited about it and get usage. Similarly, I think the developers will do that on a broad basis with their apps as well. And so I think, it is profound and we'll see what the developers do. But we're very excited to get the initial seed out there this week and see what they do. I think it will be amazing, yes.
David Vogt: Yes. No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. And Luca, just maybe -- I know you didn't give a full rundown of product categories in your prepared remarks. But if I kind of take your comments at face value, I guess what I'm trying to think about is for the next quarter, it sounds like with Services being relatively strong and FX easing a little bit. You are effectively saying that product revenue in the September quarter is going to basically be flat with the September quarter last year ahead of a product launch. And so I'm just trying to get a sense for, what are the puts and takes in that sort of outlook particularly as you have Apple Intelligence hopefully stoking the fire for demand going forward? Thanks.
Luca Maestri: Well, we have provided -- let me repeat what we provided. We think that we are going to be growing total company revenue at a rate that is similar to what we reported, so the plus 5%, right? In spite of the fact that we are going to have some foreign exchange headwinds, and we said about 150 basis points in the December quarter. And we said that we will grow Services double digits at a rate that is similar to what we've reported for the first three quarters of the fiscal year. We are not going into the other categories. I think there is a lot of good math that you can do from what we've given you here. Keep in mind on the Mac that we will have a challenging compare from a year ago, given the fact that we launched and we had the full quarter impact of the launch of the MacBook Air 15-inch a year ago. And also on the iPad, we reported 24% growth in the June quarter. Clearly we had the benefit from the launch in the June quarter of the new products, the iPad Air and the iPad Pro. So important to keep that in mind on a sequential basis.
David Vogt: Great. Thank you very much.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you David. Operator may we have the next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.
Atif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my question. The first one is for Tim. I know it's early days. The feedback on Apple Intelligence software features like notification summary and reduced interruption focus from the developers who have tried the iOS 18.1 beta version this week is very positive. My question is in response to an earlier question, you talked about a staggered launch on some of these software features. So are you expecting most of the features that you announced at WWDC to be part of iOS 18? Or we should be thinking that some of these features could potentially be part of iOS 19 next year?
Tim Cook: Our objective that we said in June is to roll out US English starting in the fall and that is to users, and then proceed with more functionality, more features, if you will, and more languages and regions coverage as we proceed across the next year. And so we sort of gave a time frame that -- and we're tracking to that.
Atif Malik: Understand. And the next one for Luca. Luca the Services growth momentum seems very strong. Are you seeing any impact from changes made to comply with the DMA rules?
Luca Maestri: Well, as you know we have introduced some changes to the way we run the App Store in Europe already in March. And we are seeing a good level of adoption from developers on those changes. We are on an ongoing basis, discussing with the European Commission how to ensure full compliance with the DMA. It is obviously early stage, but in general, our results for the Services business and for the App Store have been pretty good until now. Again to just provide you a frame of reference, the percentage of revenue that we generate from the European Union on the App Store is about 7% of the total.
Atif Malik: Very helpful. Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli : Thank you Atif. Operator may we have the next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Samik Chatterjee: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Tim, if I can just ask you about Apple Intelligence as well. There is a regulatory aspect as well in certain geographies. You mentioned the staggered launch that you are aiming for and the timelines you're thinking. How are you thinking about the complexity of the regulatory process, in particular like EU and maybe China? And does -- in terms of your timelines of the rollout, are you sort of embedding in the regulatory aspect here? And how should we think about timing then including that? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Tim Cook: We are engaged as you would guess, with both regulatory bodies that you mentioned. And our objective is to move as fast as we can, obviously because our objective is always to get features out there for everyone. We have to understand the regulatory requirements before we can commit to doing that and commit a schedule to doing that. But we're very constructively engaged with both.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay, got it. And a quick one on the Wearables category, Luca. I know you mentioned the acceleration there on a sequential basis. Maybe you can just sort of parse that out in terms of what -- which categories drove the acceleration because that's been a category that has been lagging a bit in terms of revenue trends for the past couple of quarters. So just curious what is starting to sort of drive it to accelerate on a sequential basis? Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes, I'll take that one. I think the important thing to remember when you look at the Wearables, Home and Accessories categories is that we have a difficult launch compare. And we've been running that for a few quarters and we still have that because last year had the continued benefit from the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the very first Watch Ultra. And so it is important to keep that in mind. If you sort of take a step back, however and look at the business across the trailing 12 months, it is grown -- the Wearables, Home and Accessories business has grown to almost $40 billion, which is double what it was five years ago.
Samik Chatterjee: Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Samik. Operator, may we have the last question please.
Operator: Our last question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.
Richard Kramer: Thanks. Thanks very much. Tim, you referenced the investment in innovation, and your R&D sales ratio reached what I think was a June quarter record even before launching Apple Intelligence. Do you see the rollout of these features requiring further increases in R&D or increases in OpEx or CapEx for cloud compute capacity? And is it even possible to forecast the Services usage as they roll out, given that they are so new for consumers? Thanks.
Tim Cook: Clearly, we have increased R&D over time. We have been investing in AI and ML for years. And in addition to investing more, we've also redeployed certain skills onto AI and ML. And so the growth in sort of embedded in our numbers that we've shared here, it is increasing year-over-year. On the CapEx part, it is important to remember that we employ a hybrid kind of approach, where we do things internally and we have certain partners that we do business with externally where the CapEx would appear in their respective businesses. But yes, I mean you can expect that there is -- we will continue to invest and increase it year-on-year.
Richard Kramer: Okay. And maybe a quick follow-up for Luca. When we look at the free cash flow margins for the first nine months, they are up materially. And given this year's product mix, can you describe to us what exactly in the Services mix or cost control is driving what seems to be structurally higher free cash flow margins across the business?
Luca Maestri: Yes, I'm glad you noticed that. We are pretty pleased with that fact. And I think you probably also noticed that we've increased our return of capital to shareholders this quarter. This one was a record quarter for us. Well, it's a combination of a number of things. Of course, an improvement in the top-line helps the margin expansion that we've had over the last several years and several quarters obviously has helped. And so that is driving better operating cash flow. On the CapEx front as Tim said, we employ a hybrid model. Some of the investments show up on our balance sheet and some other investments show up somewhere else and we pay, as we go. But in general, we try to run the company efficiently. We continue to think that capital efficiency is a good thing. And therefore, we are pleased with the fact that our free cash flow is doing well this year.
Richard Kramer: Okay. Thanks.

2024,Q4,2024-10-31,"Suhasini Chandramouli: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q4 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today are Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and CFO, Luca Maestri, and they'll be joined by Kevan Parekh, Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Additionally, today's discussion will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures in our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings release, which is available on our Investor Relations website. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Tim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $94.9 billion, a September quarter record and up 6% from a year ago. iPhone grew in every geographic segment, marking a new September quarter revenue record for the category, and Services set an all-time revenue record, up 12% year-over-year. We also set September quarter segment revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and the Rest of Asia Pacific, as well as in a large number of countries, including the United States, Brazil, Mexico, France, the UK, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. And we continue to be excited by the enthusiasm we're seeing in India, where we set an all-time revenue record. This has been an extraordinary year of innovation at Apple. We brought the revolutionary Apple Vision Pro to customers in February, which brings users tomorrow's technology today. And in June, we announced Apple Intelligence, a remarkable personal intelligence system that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that is incredibly useful and relevant. Apple Intelligence marks the beginning of a new chapter for Apple innovation and redefines privacy and AI by extending our groundbreaking approach to privacy into the cloud with Private Cloud Compute. Earlier this week, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in US English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users, with systemwide Writing Tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural and conversational Siri, a more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies simply by typing a description, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages. And we look forward to additional intelligence features in December, with even more powerful Writing Tools, a new visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence, and ChatGPT integration, as well as localized English in several countries, including the UK, Australia, and Canada. These features have already been provided to developers and we're getting great feedback. More features will be rolling out in the coming months, as well as support for more languages, and this is just the beginning. Now, I'll turn to our results for the quarter, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenues set a September quarter record of $46.2 billion, up 6% from a year ago, with growth in every geographic segment. With the introduction of Apple Intelligence, we're beginning a new era for iPhone. iPhone 16, powered by A18, is equipped with an incredible new 48-megapixel Fusion camera, fantastic photo experiences, and the addition of the action button and camera control. An iPhone 16 Pro is the most advanced iPhone we've ever made, powered by A18 Pro and featuring even larger displays, an industry-leading pro camera system with camera control, and studio quality mics, all with a huge leap in battery life. Turning to Mac, revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Just this week, we brought a new generation of Apple Silicon to Mac, M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. From blazing fast performance to Apple's most advanced neural engine yet, our latest chips can easily tackle incredibly complex workflows, and they ensure our newest Macs will be the best personal computers for AI the instant they hit stores. With the newest additions to our Mac lineup, customers can choose the Mac that's just right for them, whether that's iMac, the world's best and most beautiful all-in-one; MacBook Air, the world's most popular laptop now with double the starting memory; MacBook Pro, the best Pro notebook anywhere; or the incredible, mighty new Mac mini, our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac. iPad revenue was $7 billion, 8% higher year-over-year. iPad is unlike any other product on the market today, and it's become an essential device in homes, schools, and businesses of all sizes. Recently, we were thrilled to introduce the newest iPad mini, featuring an ultra-compact design built for Apple Intelligence with support for Apple Pencil Pro. It's been a big year for iPad. iPad Air was popular with students and teachers as they got back to school this year, while creators are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with the M4-powered iPad Pro. In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $9 billion, down 3% from a year ago. During the quarter, we launched the all-new Apple Watch Series 10, bringing a beautiful new design and new capabilities to the world's most popular watch that make it even more powerful, intelligent, and sophisticated. It's the thinnest Apple Watch yet, making it more comfortable than ever, while offering the biggest, most advanced display. watchOS 11 brings some huge new health and fitness insights to users, including sleep apnea notifications, which help to alert people with a potentially serious but often undiagnosed condition. We're proud of the impact we make through our health innovations on watch, and I'm grateful for every note I receive about the importance of watch in people's lives. With AirPods 4, we broke a new ground in comfort and design with our best-ever open-ear headphones available for the first time with active noise cancellation. And we were especially pleased to unveil revolutionary end-to-end hearing health capabilities for AirPods Pro 2 with hearing protection, hearing test, and hearing aid features. These just became available in a software update this week, and we believe this will make a meaningful difference in our users' lives. I've already started getting notes from customers calling the experience life changing. And Apple Vision Pro continues to deliver spatial experiences that weren't possible before, including immersive entertainment like the new short film, Submerged, which gives people a view into the unique storytelling power made possible by spatial computing. Vision Pro has more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for visionOS 2, as well as applications companies are building to reimagine how they work. Vision Pro continues to inspire awe in its users, and we're just scratching the surface of what's possible. And just yesterday, we announced we're bringing Vision Pro to Korea and the UAE. As I mentioned earlier, Services achieved an all-time revenue record of $25 billion, up 12% from a year ago, and with all-time revenue records across most of our categories. With Apple TV+, we love celebrating the craft of great storytellers who know how to put on a show. Audiences love to discover new movies like Wolfs, explore acclaimed new series like Disclaimer, and dive back into returning favorites like Slow Horses and Shrinking. Apple TV+ productions have become fixtures at award shows, earning more than 2,300 nominations and more than 500 wins today. Apple also offers a live sports experience in a league of its own with MLS Season Pass, and subscribers have been cheering on their favorite teams in the MLS Cup playoffs. This month, we also marked 10 years of Apple Pay. There's always something magical about being able to buy groceries or pay for movie tickets seamlessly with your Apple device. Today, users choose Apple Pay for purchases across tens of millions of retailers worldwide. And we're excited to make the Apple Pay experience even better, with the option to redeem rewards and access loans from credit cards, debit cards, and other lenders right at checkout. Whenever we celebrate big moments, Apple Stores are the best places to share them with customers. I had an incredible time during launch day in September alongside our team at Apple Fifth Avenue, where energy and enthusiasm filled the air. And in stores all over the world, customers are eager to get a closer look at our latest innovations. We also opened two new stores during the quarter and we can't wait to bring four new stores to customers in India. We're passionate about education and believe technology has a vital role to play in both helping teachers to inspire their students and students to learn about the world around them. In honor of World Teachers' Day, Apple was proud to share new resources for teachers to engage their students in ways that aim to make learning easy and fun. Additionally, we've expanded our education grant program into 100 new schools and communities, helping with everything from access to technology, to educator resources, to scholarships and financial support. As we near the end of the year, we're proud of the progress we've made in our efforts to be carbon-neutral across our entire footprint by the end of the decade. As I mentioned earlier, we were thrilled to introduce our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac with the latest Mac mini. And in another milestone, customers can choose a carbon-neutral option of any Apple Watch. These achievements are amazing for all of us at Apple, and we are determined to reach our 2030 goal. At Apple, across everything we do, we manage for the long term, because we're always thinking about what comes next, the next great challenge, the next innovative idea, the next big breakthrough. As we close out the year, we have the best lineup we've ever had going into the holiday season, including Apple Intelligence, which marks the start of a new chapter for our products. This is just the beginning of what we believe generative AI can do, and I couldn't be more excited for what's to come. Before I hand it over to Luca, with Luca transitioning to a new role with Apple, this will be the final time he's joining our call. So, I just wanted to take a moment to recognize his extraordinary service as Apple's CFO and to thank him for his partnership. I am deeply grateful. In his 10 years in the role, Luca has done truly exceptional work in shaping Apple as we know it today. He has helped manage Apple for the long term, thoughtfully and deliberately. He has helped us enrich the lives of so many around the world, and he has been a leader that people look up to and have learned so much from. I have incredible confidence in our incoming CFO, Kevan Parekh, and we look forward to more of you meeting and working with him going forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.
Luca Maestri: Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you, Tim, for the very kind words. Serving as Apple's CFO has been a real privilege and an amazing journey, and I've greatly appreciated the support from our investors and the analyst community over the years. Kevan is exceptional, and I know you will enjoy interacting with him going forward. Let me now turn to the results for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We're very pleased to report a new September quarter revenue record of $94.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We grew in the vast majority of the markets we track and achieved September quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe and Rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $70 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in iPhone, iPad and Mac. Our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $25 billion, up 12% year-over-year. We saw broad-based strength around the world, reaching all-time records in both developed and emerging markets with double-digit growth and record results across most services categories. Company gross margin was 46.2%, near the high end of our guidance range. Products gross margin was 36.3%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Services gross margin was 74%, unchanged from the prior quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and up 6% year-over-year. During the quarter, we recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, which relates to the impact of the reversal of the European General Court's State Aid decision. When we exclude this one-time charge, net income was $25 billion and diluted earnings per share were a $1.64, up 12% year-over-year, and a September quarter record. Operating cash flow was very strong at $26.8 billion, a new September quarter record. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year, and a September quarter record in total and across several markets, including the US, the Middle East, Korea, and South Asia. The iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the September quarter, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top-selling model in the US, Urban China, the UK, Australia, and Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction for the iPhone 15 family, with 451 Research recently measuring it at 98% in the US. Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the strength in MacBook Air. Customers have been loving the performance of Apple Silicon on Mac and we are very excited to bring the latest M4 family of chips to the lineup. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high with about half of customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And in the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 95% in the US. iPad generated $7 billion in revenue, up 8% year-over-year. In addition to growth in developed markets, we also saw strong performance in many emerging markets, with double-digit growth in Mexico, Brazil, the Middle East, India and South Asia. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the US. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9 billion, down 3% year-over-year. The Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for watch in the US. Our Services revenue reached an all-time record of $25 billion, growing 12% year-over-year. Services continue to see strong momentum with the growth of our installed base of active devices setting a solid foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. And we see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number we had only four years ago. And as always, we remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services from new games on Apple Arcade to new features like Tap to Cash and pay with installments using Apple Pay to many successful new and returning shows on Apple TV+. This past quarter, we celebrated the five-year anniversary of Apple Card, which was ranked #1 in customer satisfaction among co-branded credit cards by J.D. Power for the fourth year in a row. Turning to enterprise, we continue to see strong demand across our products and services. NVIDIA launched its Mac as a choice program supported by AppleCare for Enterprise and Apple Professional Services with over 10,000 Macs deployed worldwide. And Novartis, a leading global pharmaceutical company, recently chose iPhone 16 as the standard mobile device for all employees. We also see continued momentum with Apple Vision Pro in the enterprise space. UC San Diego Health is the first hospital in the world to test spatial computing apps on Apple Vision Pro in clinical trials for patient surgery in the operating room. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $157 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.6 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $7 billion, leaving us with total debt of $107 billion. As a result, net cash was $50 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $29 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect our December quarter total company revenue to grow low- to mid-single digits year-over-year. We expect Services revenue to grow double-digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the fiscal year 2024. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments. And our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on November 14, 2024 to shareholders of record as of November 11, 2024. With that, let us open the call to questions.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?
Operator: Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. I just have two. The first one is for Tim on Apple Intelligence. I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit on some of the early feedback to Apple Intelligence both for iOS 18.1, but also the developer beta so far, and whether you would attribute Apple Intelligence to any of the strong iPhone performance that we've seen to date. Thanks.
Tim Cook: Thanks, Michael. As I noted in my comments, just this week on Monday, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in US English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This includes things like systemwide Writing Tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural conversational Siri, more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies, simply by typing a description, which is really cool, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages. There's also email summaries and email priority. We're getting a lot of positive feedback from developers and customers. And in fact, if you just look at the first three days, which is all we have obviously from Monday, the 18.1 adoption is twice as fast as the 17.1 adoption was in the year-ago quarter. And so, there's definitely interest out there for Apple Intelligence. Carrying on in the quarter, we are looking forward to bringing even more features in December, and this will include even more powerful Writing Tools and visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence, and ChatGPT integration in addition to other features, as well as we'll bring localized English to several countries that include the UK, Australia, and Canada. So, it's going to be quite a software quarter between the release on Monday and the release in December. And then, as we turn the corner to '25, we'll have more languages rolling out, starting in April as well and more features as well. And so, it's a very strong drumbeat, and we couldn't be more excited about it.
Michael Ng: Great. Thank you very much. And my second one just for Luca. First, congratulations again, Luca, on the new role and it's been a real privilege being able to spend some time with you. A question that I think will overlap with your new role as well. Could you just talk a little bit about the CapEx outlook and whether investments in things like Private Cloud Compute could change the historical CapEx range of roughly $10 billion a year? Thank you very much.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Michael. On the CapEx front, I've mentioned before a number of times, we have a bit of a hybrid model in the way we run our data centers. In some cases, we use our own data centers. In some cases, we use, third-party providers. So, our CapEx numbers may not be fully comparable with others. But, obviously, we are rolling out these features, Apple Intelligence features already now, and so we are making all the capacity that is needed available for these features. You will see in our 10-K the amount of CapEx that we've incurred during the course of fiscal '24, and we will -- in fiscal '25, we will continue to make all the investments that are necessary, and of course, the investments in AI-related CapEx will be made.
Michael Ng: Great. Thank you, Tim. Thank you, Luca.
Suhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thanks, Mike. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Tim, maybe if we start with you, I think each of the last four years you've exited the December quarter with iPhone demand outpacing supply. As we look to this quarter in the iPhone 16 cycle, lead times are relatively short. There are no known supply shortages. And I'm just curious whether you've been able to maybe get a better read on early cycle iPhone demand this year relative to past years. And if so, what you've learned about upgrade rates, switching rates, trade-ups versus trading down and being more price sensitive? And overall, any impact that Apple Intelligence may have on iPhone 16 sales? And then, I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Tim Cook: There's a lot there. On Apple Intelligence, we believe it's a compelling upgrade reason. And we'll -- but we just launched it three days ago and so what we've got now from a data point point of view is the number I just referenced that 18.1 has twice the adoption rate of 17.1. So, that clearly shows a level of interest out there. In terms of exiting the December quarter with demand greater than supply, that's not my recollection that, that happened for all four of the years. We clearly had cases during COVID where there were disruptions and that's the some spilled over, but in a more regular environment where we're not having something, a 100-year flood kind of thing, we would -- our desire is to get into balance as quickly as possible. We don't want customers having to wait for products. And so, if you look at how we've done this year, we did that very quickly on the 16, on the 16 Pro family, the Pro and the Pro Max, we've been constrained in October, but we believe that soon we'll be out of constraint. And so, that's a good sign from our point of view. Keep in mind that, that's a function of supply and demand, not one side or the other. And we've been preparing for the quarter for a while. So that's what I would say there.
Erik Woodring: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Tim.
Tim Cook: Yeah, thank you.
Erik Woodring: And then, Luca, if I just turn to you, obviously, it's been a pleasure working with you, and we wish you all the best in the next role. There's plenty of debate in the market right now about input costs and commodity prices, and the impact that will have on gross margins. Historically, you do guide gross margins up 50 basis points sequentially, which you just told us about for the December quarter. So, can you maybe just help us understand your view of component prices and broadly whether you still see those as tailwinds to gross margins and how sustainable that tailwind might be, or whether that should become a headwind as we look forward? Thanks so much.
Luca Maestri: Yes, Erik. As you know, our gross margins are a factor of many, many variables. Commodities, of course, are important. They're not the only factor. But specifically on commodities, I can tell you that both for the September quarter and what we expect for the December quarter, most commodities are going to move down in price, while NAND and DRAM increased during the course of the September quarter and we expect them to increase during the December quarter. We are very pleased with the level of gross margins that we've reported during the course of the year. The entire fiscal year of '24, they're really, for our company, record levels of gross margin, and obviously guiding to 46% to 47% for the December quarter with all the new technologies that we've included in the products, with all the new features that Tim has talked about, a lot of new products across the board, I think it's a very good sign.
Erik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much, Luca.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Erik. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes from Melius. Please go ahead.
Ben Reitzes: Hey, thanks a lot. And I'll echo those comments about Luca. Miss you, and good luck. And my question is with regard to iPhone again, and with regard to the fourth quarter, is my first question -- or sorry, the fourth calendar quarter, your first quarter. When you look at mid- to low-single-digit revenue growth, do you expect the iPhone to grow faster? And what are you thinking about in the answer to that question with regard to China, which keeps improving each quarter? Thanks very much. And then, I have just a follow-up. Thanks.
Luca Maestri: Ben, we are not providing that level of color today. Yes, we've said that we expect total company revenue to grow low- to mid-single digits. Keep in mind, Apple Intelligence, as Tim said, is rolling out over time, both features and languages. And we just had a number of exciting launches just this week from the Apple Intelligence feature to the new Mac. So, we leave it at that. We've given you the total for the company and some pretty good direction on Services, which we expect to continue to grow at a similar rate than what we've seen in fiscal '24.
Ben Reitzes: Great. Thanks, Luca. Hey, Tim, I wanted to ask you, I mean, you guys are well aware a lot of the noise out there, people chattering about builds, lead times, and you guys are guiding for mid- to low-single-digit growth. That certainly doesn't sound like alarm bells here, vis-a-vis what you guys must be hearing. And I know you guys are just running your business and doing the best you can, but you have a lot of perspective now, Tim. What are people missing here? And it certainly just sounds like -- you guys are typically conservative. That guide for revenue is certainly sounds like [this guy is certainly not falling] (ph), and you have a pretty good product cycle. So, what do you think people are missing and what are you excited about? Thanks so much, Tim.
Tim Cook: Ben, I could not be more excited about Apple Intelligence and the rollout that we've got in front of us. I'm on the -- I'm obviously on future releases as well, working on it and it's changing my daily life. I'm super excited about the health features that we're rolling out. If the number of emails I'm already getting from customers that have taken a hearing test and are using their AirPods Pro 2 as a hearing aid, are just -- are staggering and heartwarming to read. I'm also thrilled about sleep apnea and the notification there that we'll have through the watch. This week is a very exciting week for us because we just rolled out three days -- three launches of different, Macs and desktops and laptops. And so, we have a lot of things on the docket and it's definitely the strongest lineup we've ever had going into the holiday season. In terms of the noise, I tune it out, because if not, it would just be, deafening. And so that that's what I do, I can't speak for everybody else, but that's what I do.
Ben Reitzes: Thanks a lot, Tim. Appreciate it.
Tim Cook: Thanks, Ben.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two as well. And Luca, best of luck in the future. It's been a pleasure working with you. I guess the first one I have is, away from iPhones, on the Services side, you're adding $100 billion run rate with Services today, which is a phenomenal achievement by itself. As you look at the Services portfolio today, can you just talk about how much of this business do you think is reoccurring versus transactional? And are the growth rates different between the subscription portfolio over here versus transactional portfolio?
Luca Maestri: Yes, Amit, I'll take this one. Yes, we are, first of all, very, very happy with -- it's an important milestone. Of course, we've got to a run rate of $100 billion. You look back just a few years ago, and the growth has been phenomenal. We're very pleased. We've got a very diversified portfolio of services. And over the years, the amount that is recurring in nature has grown and is growing faster than the transactional piece. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions on our platform right now between our own services and third-party services. That continues to grow strong double-digits. So, we feel very, very good. And, essentially, to your question, yes, the recurring portion is growing faster than the transactional one.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. If I can just follow-up, if I look at the growth rates across the different geographies, there's always concern around China when it comes to iPhone demand, I feel, but the performance in September looks fairly good. I wonder if you just touch on, what are you seeing from a demand perspective in China? If the recent stimulus plan in China could essentially be a catalyst for iPhone? And then, EMEA really stood out with double-digit growth. Maybe you can just flush that out as well for us. Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yeah, I'll take the China question. If you look at how we did for the quarter, we were relatively flat year-over-year. And a key component of that improvement relative to the year-over-year performance that we had been achieving is that there was a sequential improvement in foreign exchange. And so that helped us out. As you know, it's been a headwind that we've been reporting for a period of time. And -- but the other parts that are -- what else is going on there is that our installed base of the active devices reached an all-time high. We had the top two selling, smartphones in Urban China according to Kantar. The level of new customers that we have buying the products like Mac and iPad are well over 50%. Watch is over three quarters that are new to the product. And so, there's several positive signs there. In terms of the stimulus, it's a clear focus of the team there, but I'm not an economist and don't want to ad lib on the effect of it.
Luca Maestri: On the Europe side, Amit, a number of things. As you see from our results during the quarter, Europe grew double-digits, 11%, and really, it was really good growth across the board, the different segments. They all did well. Keep in mind, our definition of Europe in our segment reporting includes a number of emerging markets, like Turkey, where we've grown very strongly, the Middle East. Tim mentioned a number of records in Saudi, in UAE, and we also include India where we set an all-time revenue record during the September quarter. But I have to say also Western Europe grew nicely. So, we've seen very good results for us in the entire segment.
Amit Daryanani: Great. Thank you very much.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Vogt: Great. Thanks everyone for taking my question, and congratulations, Luca. I know Luca, and I know Tim, you don't want to give a lot of granularity, but if I just try to pull together your comments about what the demand environment looks like, are we to assume based on sort of the commentary that there is a risk that maybe the product revenue portfolio could be down in the December quarter if I take your numbers at face value? And if that's the risk, is that more iPhone-related, Mac-related, given the strength that you've seen in iPad related? Just trying to get a handle on kind of what potentially is giving you that degree of, I don't want to say caution, but maybe balanced for you going into the December quarter. And then, I have a follow-up.
Luca Maestri: As I said, David, we're not providing that level of color. We're giving you some data on services. I would repeat what I said earlier. We're very early in the cycle, very early in the cycle with a lot of new products and features that that we are launching. And we're very excited about them, but it's early. And the Apple Intelligence rollout is going to happen over time, not across the world as normally we do with software releases.
David Vogt: Right. Okay. So maybe a follow-up for, Tim. When you think about to Luca's point about the rollout being staged over the next several quarters across the world, do you think that has any impact on sort of the normal historical demand cadence across different regions? So, should we see something different, let's say, in the December quarter, the March quarter, the June quarter, et cetera, relative to history, given the timing of the rollout and where customers are probably waiting for the devices to be enabled to have the operating system? Would just love to kind of get your perspective on how we think about the demand cadence, how it might be different than maybe historically? Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yeah, David. It's clearly, as you point out, a different cadence, if you will, than we would normally do. As we talked about at WWDC, we wanted to give a comprehensive vision of Apple Intelligence, and we said then that it would rollout over time. And we're right on the, what we said, at WWDC, and so we're executing well. In terms of the demand curve, I would just say that what we believe here is that it's a compelling reason for upgrading. And, it's -- that's both my personal experience and feedback that I'm getting and so we'll see. We're not projecting, beyond the current quarter obviously. We just don't do that.
David Vogt: Great. Thanks, Tim, and best of luck, Luca.
Luca Maestri: Thank you very much.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, David. We'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Luca, we will miss you on these calls. Tim, maybe for you, as you think about this staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence, can you help us think through potentially how much of the global installed base of phones will have access to Apple Intelligence in their native language, in their region within the next year or maybe in the next two years? And what are some of the gating factors in the rollout? And I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook: If you look at our schedule, we started in the -- with US English, that started on Monday. There's another release coming that adds additional features that I had referenced in December in not only US English but also localized for UK, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. And then, we will add more languages in April. We haven't set the specifics yet in terms of the languages, but we'll add more in April and then more as we step through the year. And so, we're moving just as fast as possible while ensuring quality. That's what we're doing.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Tim.
Tim Cook: Yeah.
Wamsi Mohan: And then, as a follow-up, maybe this is a little premature, but how is Apple at a high level prepared to potentially deal with any tariffs that might come post the selection cycle? And if not exactly how, perhaps you can just help investors think about some of the things Apple has done already to try to insulate from some of these impacts, potential impacts?
Tim Cook: I wouldn't want to speculate about those sorts of things. And so, I'm going to punt on that one.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you, Tim.
Tim Cook: Yeah. Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Wamsi. May we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. And again, thanks Luca for all your help with analyts and investors. My first question is on R&D. Given how much your tech peers are spending on AI, does this new era of Apple Intelligence actually require Apple to invest more in R&D beyond your current 7% to 8% of sales to capture this opportunity? And then, I had a follow-up.
Luca Maestri: Krish, as you know, we've been investing heavily in R&D over the last several years. Our R&D growth has been significant during the last several years. And obviously, as we move through the course of fiscal '24, we've also reallocated some of the existing resources to this new technology to AI. And so, the level of intensity that we're putting into AI has increased a lot, and you maybe don't see the full extent of it because we've also had some internal reallocation of the base of engineering resources that we have within the company.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Thanks for that, Luca. And then, another quick follow-up. I understand Apple Intelligence is a feature on the phone today, but do you think that, in the future, it could potentially have or benefit the services growth business, or is that too -- are these too bifurcated to even make a call on the [indiscernible]? Thank you.
Tim Cook: I think, just to keep it in mind, Apple Intelligence is also available on the Mac for the M-series products and on certain models of iPad, and in addition to the phone. And so, it's on all three. You're quite -- what was your follow-on question?
Krish Sankar: Tim, it does on -- can the Apple Intelligence actually help the Services growth rate?
Tim Cook: Keep in mind that we were have released a lot of APIs and developers will be taking advantage of those APIs. That release has occurred as well and of course more are coming. And so I, definitely believe that a lot of developers will be taking advantage of Apple Intelligence in a big way. And what that does to Services, I'll not forecast, but I would say that from an ecosystem point of view, I think it will be great for the user and the user experience.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Thanks, Tim.
Tim Cook: Yeah.
Suhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thank you, Krish. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Samik Chatterjee: Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. And Luca, congrats on the new role and pleasure working with you these years. I guess, if I could, for my first one, start with mix on the iPhone side? And what I'm really curious about if you have any thoughts given that Apple Intelligence is now going to be a consistent feature set across all the four sort of iPhones on the iPhone 16 series that you launched and going back to iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. Are you seeing any change in behavior from a consumer perspective in terms of which sort of on the mix front within the iPhone series where consumer adoption is given that there's more consistency of the features when it comes to Apple Intelligence across the board? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Tim Cook: It's tough to answer your question, because we've been constrained in October on the Pro and the Pro Max. And so, it's really too early in the curve to call the precise mix on the consumer versus the Pro. So, we'll see.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay. And for my follow-up, Tim, during the quarter I think over the last 90 days, we had the quotes come out in relation to the DOJ relative to the Google sort of revenue sharing agreement that you have with them. How do you sort of look at it going forward in terms of emphasizing the role that Apple has in that ecosystem with Safari and sort of the potential outcomes that you're looking at? Thank you.
Tim Cook: I don't want to speculate on that from a legal point of view. It's an ongoing case, and I will save that for another day.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you. I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thank you, Samik. Operator, may we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.
Richard Kramer: Thanks very much. My first one, Tim, I'd like to ask about some of the components in Services where despite your installed base, some parts of the Apple One bundle, like Music and News and Arcade and Fitness, are not obviously the market-leading offerings. And maybe what might change that and what other services could you call out as growing faster, having wider -- widening addressable markets like we've seen in pay or advertising?
Tim Cook: The way that I view it is that we have lots of opportunity in all of those. And so, there's lots of customers to try to convince to take advantage of it, and we're going to continue investing in the Services and adding new features and -- whether it's News+ or Music or Arcade, that's what we're going to do. Keep in mind that for us, we're more focused on being best than being most. And so, in some cases, not in every case, some of the services that you -- the majority of the services that you mentioned are not cross platform. We make them for our customers only and so that in some cases changes the person who's going to sell the most perhaps, but that's -- our objective is to make the best.
Richard Kramer: Okay, thanks. And then, Luca, one piece of unfinished business was your pledge to get to a net-neutral cash position. And over the last two years, you stayed around $50 billion of net cash. We've clearly seen instances in the past where elevated marketing spend or other programs brought increases in market share. I guess my question looking back on your tenure is, at your scale now of $57 billion of OpEx, do you still see incremental ways to put that cash to work in the business? Or will we just continue to see increased shareholder returns?
Luca Maestri: Well, obviously, as you've seen, our OpEx has gone up over the years. We've also seen at the same time a significant expansion in gross margin, maybe to a level that I would have not expected a few years ago, but we've done a very good job on a number of fronts. And so, I would say we -- when we plan -- every time we plan for the upcoming year, we think about all the different areas where we can deploy our resources and we make them available to grow the business. I think we've done very well over the long term and -- but our fundamental philosophy is to look after the business first. And then, if we have excess cash, we will continue to return it to our shareholders and the plan has worked quite well so far.
Richard Kramer: Okay. Thank you very much.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. We'll take our last question, please, operator?
Operator: Our last question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.
Atif Malik: Thank you for squeezing me in. It seems to us that the spec differentiation between iPhone 16 Pro and base model isn't as big as prior years. All iPhones have new A18, A18 Pro chips and there wasn't an increase in ASPs versus last year. Can you share with us if there is a shift in your strategy in terms of...
Operator: Unfortunately, Mr. Malik's line has dropped.
Suhasini Chandramouli: All right. Sorry, Atif. We'll connect offline. Thank you, everybody.

2024,Q1,2024-04-29,"Operator: Good morning. My name is Jordan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the SoFi Technologies Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
 With that, you may begin your conference. 
Paulina Gutierrez: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to SoFi's First Quarter of 2024 earnings conference call.
 Joining me today to talk about our results and recent events are Anthony Noto, CEO; and Christopher Lapointe, CFO. You can find the presentation accompanying our earnings release on the Investor Relations section of our website.
 Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations and forecasts and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, our competitive advantage and strategy, macroeconomic conditions and outlook, future products and services and future business and financial performance.
 Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are described in today's press release and our subsequent filings made with the SEC, including our upcoming Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
 And now I'd like to turn the call over to Anthony. 
Anthony Noto: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Q1 was another exceptionally strong quarter for SoFi. We continue to successfully execute on our strategy of making SoFi the one-stop shop for digital financial services. We expected that 2024 would be an important year of transition. Heading into this year, we had a conservative outlook given interest rate volatility, industry liquidity, inflation and macroeconomic environment concerns.
 We planned for continued strong growth from our financial services and technology platform segments up 50% year-over-year, offsetting our plan for lending to be 92% to 95% of 2023 revenue. And we set out to strengthen our balance sheet and capital ratios by continuing to grow our tangible book value. I'm proud to report that our team delivered across each of these fronts and more in the first quarter of 2024.
 First, we responsibly grew revenue, while further diversifying our business. We grew adjusted net revenue in Q1 to $581 million, up 26% year-over-year. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter of greater than 25% growth. We grew adjusted EBITDA to $144 million, up 91% year-over-year. This represents a 25% margin compared to 16% a year ago.
 I'm pleased to report that our Financial Services and Technology Platform segments make up a growing portion of our revenue quarter-over-quarter, contributing 42% of adjusted net revenue in Q1. This is up from 40% last quarter and 33% a year ago, and we remain on track to finish 2024 with our revenue mix near 50-50.
 Second, we posted GAAP net income of $88 million. This includes a $59 million onetime benefit from the recent exchange of convertible notes, which Chris will talk about more in a moment. After achieving our first quarter of GAAP profitability in Q4 2023, we committed to sustaining profitability for the full year of 2024, and we did so in Q1. We posted GAAP EPS of $0.02 per share, which excludes the benefit from the convertible note exchange.
 Third, we further reinforced our balance sheet for long-term growth. We grew tangible book value for the seventh consecutive quarter to $4.1 billion, an increase of $608 million from the prior quarter. Equally as important, our tangible book value per share now stands at $3.92, up 16% sequentially. We grew consumer deposits by a record of $3 billion and saw continued strong buying demands for our loans, selling over $1.9 billion of loans in Q1.
 SoFi Bank reported net income of $100 million with a 21% margin, and a return on tangible equity of 11.7%. Our total capital ratio for SoFi Technologies is now 17.3%, a 200 basis point improvement from last quarter and well above our 10.5% regulatory minimum.
 Finally, our broad product offering, enabling people to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect their money continues to attract more and more members to SoFi. In Q1, we grew our member base to 8.1 million, up 44% from the prior year, adding 622,000 new members in the quarter. Just as important, we continue to see members adopt more products and deepen the relationship with SoFi.
 We recorded 989,000 new product additions in the quarter, with 93% of those product adds coming in our Financial Services segment, a remarkable milestone considering it's been only 5 years since we launched our first non-lending products and 2 years since we launched SoFi Bank.
 This increasingly diverse product relationship with our members is what maximizes the power of the Financial Services productivity loop and allows us to leverage our unique structural economic advantage. Despite external unpredictability in the year ahead, I remain as confident as ever in SoFi's future. Our plan to sustain responsible growth and our ability to deliver meaningful value to our shareholders.
 Before handing it over to Chris to cover our financial highlights and share updated guidance, I wanted to give a quick peek under the hood on our segment level results. Starting with Financial Services. We continue to drive acquisition and monetization and importantly, rapidly expanding margins. We achieved record net revenue of $151 million in Q1, up 86% year-over-year and 8% from the prior quarter. Demonstrating the strong operating leverage in this segment, we generated this 86% growth with only an 8% increase in directly attributable expenses year-over-year.
 The overall Financial Services segment achieved $37 million in contribution profit at a 25% margin compared to a $24 million loss in the year ago quarter. That margin is up 7 points from last quarter and a full 22 points from our first quarter of segment profitability achieved in the third quarter of 2023.
 This progress is notable given our significant investment across our Money, Credit Card and Invest products. SoFi Money delivered strong growth, high-quality deposits and engagement, and higher average account balances even as spending increased. We grew to 3.9 million SoFi Money accounts, up 61% year-over-year with over 90% of our consumer deposits coming from direct deposit members.
 Our direct deposit members have a median FICO of 744 and over 50% of our newly funded SoFi Money account setup direct deposit by day 30, presenting ample opportunities for cross-buy into other SoFi products. As these members make SoFi Money their account of choice, spending follows with overall debit transaction volume, exceeding $1.9 billion in the quarter, up 20% from the prior quarter and over 150% year-over-year.
 Looking at our Credit Card and Invest products, we previously shared that these are our heaviest areas of investment in the Financial Services segment, with current losses of nearly $100 million annually on a run rate basis. However, through improved unit economics and scale, we expect that these products will eventually contribute profit similar to our progress with SoFi Money.
 Next, turning to our Technology Platform segment. Our consistent product development and successful shift in sales strategy has enabled us to diversify growth and pursue larger, more durable revenue opportunities. In Q1, we exceeded $94 million in revenue, representing 21% year-over-year growth versus 13% last quarter, in line with our guidance for accelerating growth. Our Tech Platform segment contribution margin was 33% compared to 32% last quarter and 19% a year ago.
 Demand from traditional financial institutions and clients in nonfinancial categories remain strong. While lead times for winning RFPs and integrations and time to revenue are measured in multiple quarters and years, not months, we're seeing the transition to modern processing and modern cores playing out as envisioned.
 We also made significant strides in product development in Q1. We enhanced our partnership with the Bancorp to offer real-time payments, improving the money movement hub, enabling multiple new use cases for B2C and B2B clients. We launched post-purchase buy now, pay later for banks and fintechs to deliver flexible financing solutions for debit and credit purchases.
 Galileo and SoFi Bank partnered to launch a small business financing card program with Rapid Finance. And importantly, we continue to make progress with our growing pipeline of new partners in the quarter.
 And finally, turning to lending. As we shared last quarter, we've taken a more conservative approach toward originations given our concerns around rate uncertainty and the broader macro climate. For Q1, adjusted net revenue of $325 million was flat year-over-year. Personal loan origination growth slowed to 11% year-over-year to $3.3 billion, in line with our more conservative approach. In fact, the balance of personal loans on our balance sheet declined 2% quarter-over-quarter.
 Student loan originations grew 43% year-over-year to $752 million and home loan originations increased 274% year-over-year to $336 million. A record 82% of the segment's adjusted net revenue was derived from net interest income compared to 76% last quarter and 62% in the year ago quarter. This is a direct benefit of our bank charter and our ability to hold loans longer when advantageous.
 The percent of adjusted lending revenue from net interest income has more than doubled since we launched the bank 2 years ago. Together, these efforts contributed to great results for SoFi in the first quarter of 2024. I am incredibly proud of our team's perseverance to serve our members and clients' financial needs in face of continued volatility and uncertainty around the world, while delivering good consistent growth, profitability and shareholder value creation.
 With that, I'll hand it over to Chris. 
Chris Lapointe: Thanks, Anthony. The first quarter demonstrates strong evidence of how our increasingly diversified and differentiated business model drive SoFi's durability and long-term growth potential. I'm going to walk through key financial highlights and our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the first quarter of 2024 versus first quarter of 2023. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release, and the subsequent 10-Q filing, which will be made available next month.
 For the quarter, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $581 million, with growth of 26% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $144 million at a 25% margin. This represented over 8 points of year-over-year margin improvement, demonstrating significant operating leverage across all functional expense lines.
 In fact, sales and marketing declined as a percentage of adjusted net revenue by 9 points relative to the year ago quarter, while total noninterest operating expenses declined 16 points year-over-year.
 We delivered our second quarter of GAAP profitability with GAAP net income reaching $88 million, a $122 million improvement year-over-year. Net income included the benefit of a $59 million net gain associated with the exchange of a portion of our 2026 convertible notes at a discount for equity during the quarter. We reported GAAP diluted EPS of $0.02, which was not impacted by the gain from the convertible note exchange.
 Now on to the segment level performance. Starting with Financial Services, where net revenue of $151 million increased 86% year-over-year with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money and Lending as a Service, as well as continued contributions from SoFi Invest and Credit Card.
 Overall monetization continues to improve with annualized revenue per product of $59, up 31% year-over-year versus $45 in Q1 2023. This is driven by higher deposits and member spending levels in SoFi Money, greater AUM and monetizable features in SoFi Invest and robust growth within SoFi Credit Card spend.
 Net interest income increased 106% year-over-year, primarily driven by $11.5 billion growth in deposits year-over-year. Our noninterest income increased 34% year-over-year, primarily driven by 2 factors: interchange, which grew 65% year-over-year based on over $7.5 billion in annualized spend and referrals from our Lending as a Service product, which grew 32% versus the prior year period.
 Contribution profit reached $37 million at a 25% margin for the quarter, even as we continue to invest to rapidly grow this segment. Despite our invest in credit card businesses collectively losing nearly $100 million on an annualized basis, we still achieved strong margins.
 Lastly, we reached 10.1 million Financial Services products in the quarter, which is up 42% year-over-year, with 919,000 new products in the quarter. We reached nearly 3.9 million products in SoFi Money, 2.2 million in SoFi Invest and 3.6 million in Relay.
 Shifting to our Tech Platform, where we delivered net revenue of $94 million in the quarter, up 21% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Annual revenue growth was driven by strong performance from new clients onboarded over the last 9 months, large bank deals signed in Latin America and strong monetization of existing clients launching new products on our platform.
 Galileo accounts grew 20% year-over-year to $151 million. The segment delivered a contribution profit of $31 million, representing a 33% margin. We continue to leverage investments made in the segment as we continue to position Tech Platform for higher rates of diversified, durable growth going forward. We expect Tech Platform revenue to accelerate in 2024 with strong margins.
 Turning to lending. First quarter adjusted net revenue remained flat year-over-year at $325 million, with $208 million of contribution profit at a 64% margin versus $210 million a year ago. These results were driven by a 33% year-over-year growth in our net interest income, while noninterest income was down by 53%.
 Growth in net interest income was driven by a 59% year-over-year increase in average interest-earning assets and a 114 basis point year-over-year increase in average yields. This resulted in an average net interest margin of 5.91% for the quarter, up 43 basis points year-over-year.
 I'd also highlight our $3 billion of deposit growth in the quarter compared to the $242 million of net loan growth on the balance sheet. This has allowed us to continue to reduce our reliance on outside warehouse funding, which is 226 basis points more expensive than our deposits.
 As a result, we've reduced our warehouse utilization this quarter by $2.4 billion. The 226 basis points of cost savings between our deposits and our warehouse facilities continues to support our net interest margin and translates to nearly $500 million of annualized interest expense savings at our current deposit base.
 It also underscores the benefits of having the option of holding loans on balance sheet when advantageous and collecting net interest income. We expect to maintain a healthy net interest margin above 5% for the foreseeable future and benefit from the continued mix towards deposit funding, along with our ability to sustain healthy deposit versus lending betas.
 On the noninterest income side, Q1 originations grew 22% year-over-year to $4.4 billion and were driven by growth across our personal, student and home loan products. Personal loan originations growth slowed to 11% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to $3.3 billion, which was anticipated and in line with our more conservative approach given macro uncertainty.
 Our student loans business saw origination volume grow 43% year-over-year, with a slight 5% decline sequentially to $752 million. Home loans grew by over 270% year-over-year and 9% sequentially to $336 million. Our personal loan borrowers weighted average income is $169,000, with a weighted average FICO score of 746. Our student loan borrowers weighted average income is $146,000, with a weighted average FICO of 768.
 In the first quarter, we sold portions of our personal loan, student loan and home loan portfolios totaling over $1.9 billion. That comprises approximately $1.26 billion in personal loan principal, $300 million in student loan principal and nearly $350 million in home loan principal.
 In terms of personal loan sales, we closed $500 million of loans in whole loan form and $700 million in ABS at a blended execution of 105.7%. These had similar structures to other recent personal loan sales, with cash proceeds at par or at a small premium to par, and the majority of the premium consisted of contractual servicing fees that are capitalized.
 These deals included a small loss share provision that is above our base assumption of losses and immaterial relative to the exposure we would otherwise have if we held the loans. As a result of the personal loan sales in the quarter, the quantity of personal loans on our balance sheet declined sequentially despite growth in originations.
 Additionally, we sold $62.5 million of late-stage delinquent personal loans principal in the quarter. Typically, we do not sell delinquent loans until they are charged off, but we were able to generate positive value generated from both recovery and servicing value relative to letting the loans charge off and sell after the fact.
 As discussed during Q4 results, roughly 15% of our losses came from credit tiers that we ceased originating several quarters earlier, which represented 3% of unpaid principal balance. We were, therefore, able to reduce exposure to those credit tiers, as the loans run off and become a much smaller portion of overall unpaid principal balance.
 In addition, we continue to make adjustments to our credit underwriting model in line with the internal and external indicators underlying are our report card.
 Moving to our student loan sales. we closed $294 million of loans in whole loan form and execution of 104.9%. This sale had no accompanying loss share provision nor a senior secured financing option.
 Finally, our $344 million of home loan sales were sold at a blended execution of 100.9%. Also in the quarter, we executed $399 million of senior secured financing, which will show up on our detailed balance sheet as senior secured loans held for investment at amortized costs. These loans have a fixed term structure and are secured against the underlying assets, therefore, equivalent to the investment-grade bonds, if we were to do a securitization for the same pool of collateral.
 In addition, these loans are priced at market rates, which not only helps to diversify our balance sheet, but also provides an additional return above our cost of funding and a yield similar to the net interest margin of our loans, which are unsecured.
 Turning to credit performance. Our on-balance sheet 90-day student loan delinquency rate was 13 basis points, while our annualized student loan charge-off rate was 60 basis points. Our Q1 on-balance sheet 90-day personal loan delinquency rate was 72 basis points.
 Our annualized personal loan charge-off rate decreased to 3.45% from 4.02% in Q4, including the impact of asset sales, new originations and the delinquency sale in the quarter. We anticipate ongoing normalization in credit performance toward pre-pandemic levels of 7% to 8% life of loan losses.
 Now turning to our fair value marks and key assumptions. Our personal loans are marked at 104.2% as of quarter end, down from 104.9% at the end of Q4 and well below the 105.7% blended execution achieved on the $1.2 billion in personal loan sales.
 The lower personal loan mark was primarily a function of the discount rate increasing by approximately 30 basis points to 5.8%. This was driven by the underlying benchmark rate increasing by approximately 50 basis points and spreads tightening by 20 basis points, in line with industry trends. Importantly, the benchmark rate change and the spread change are empirical as they are actual market observed inputs, not assumptions.
 In addition, the mark was negatively impacted by the annual default rate increasing by 9 basis points to 4.85%, and the annual prepayment fees increasing by 150 basis points to 24.7%, which has an immaterial impact on the overall change in the mark.
 When a borrower prepays, we are still capturing the principal and the impact to the value of the asset is only based on the premium above par at a given point in time, which is very small relative to the principal outstanding.
 The weighted average coupon on the personal loan portfolio remained unchanged at 13.8%. For our student loan portfolio, the fair value mark remained unchanged at 103.8% at quarter end. In terms of the inputs, our weighted average coupon remained flat at 5.6%, annual losses remained flat at 60 basis points, prepayments increased by 8 basis points to 10.5%, and the discount rate remained unchanged at 4.3%.
 As mentioned previously, we sold $294 million of student loan collateral in the quarter. Had we not sold those assets, the student loan discount rate would have increased by a similar magnitude as our personal loans business.
 Switching to our balance sheet, where we remain very well capitalized with ample cash and liquidity. Assets grew by $1.2 billion, largely as a result of $242 million growth in loans and approximately $803 million growth in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities.
 On the liability side, deposits grew by $3 billion sequentially to nearly $22 billion. As mentioned earlier, we reduced our reliance on warehouse facilities through our robust deposit growth and exited the quarter with approximately $800 million of warehouse debt drawn.
 In Q1, we opportunistically executed 2 transactions in order to optimize our financing structure and bolster our capital capacity. First, we issued $862.5 million in convertible notes due in 2029 at a 1.25% coupon. The net proceeds are being used to replace higher cost financing, including the redemption of the $320 million of outstanding Series 1 preferred stock that carries an annual dividend of 12.5%, which was set to increase to over 15% in late May.
 In total, this new convertible issuance should reduce our financing expense by $40 million to $60 million per year, including cost-saving opportunities with the remaining proceeds.
 Second, we agreed to an exchange of $600 million principal of our convertible notes due in 2026 for shares of SoFi common stock. This was a notable discount compared to what we would have had to pay in 2 years. This transaction generated a gain of $59 million for us in the quarter, while notably reducing our 2026 maturities and bolstering our funding capacity.
 When viewed in total, these transactions are accretive to book value and net income, and have minimal impact on a fully diluted EPS basis. In terms of our regulatory capital ratios, our total capital ratio of 17.3%, improved by 200 basis points from 15.3% last quarter due in large part to these transactions and remains comfortably above the regulatory minimum of 10.5%.
 While we don't intend to utilize the excess capital capacity in the year, given our view of the macro uncertainty, these transactions put us in an even stronger position for years to come.
 Lastly, we grew book value to $6.1 billion and tangible book value to $4.1 billion. We recorded tangible book value per share at $3.92, up 16% quarter-over-quarter.
 Now moving on to our updated guidance. Throughout the last 12 months, we have demonstrated the benefit of having a diversified high growth set of revenue streams, multiple cost-efficient sources of capital, our continued key focus on underwriting high-quality credit and a high degree of operating leverage as we scale the business. We expect those benefits to persist going forward even in light of the existing macro backdrop. 
 2024 remains a transitional year for SoFi, as the Tech Platform and Financial Services segments together will drive our growth and increase from 38% of total adjusted net revenue in 2023 to approximately 50% for all of 2024.
 For the full year 2024, we now expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $2.39 billion to $2.43 billion, which is $25 million higher than our implied prior guidance range of $2.365 billion to $2.405 billion. This guidance assumes lending revenue will be 92% to 95% of 2023 levels, which is unchanged from prior guidance and Tech Platform will grow approximately 20% year-over-year, which is also unchanged.
 We expect the Financial Services segment revenue to grow more than 75% year-over-year. We now expect adjusted EBITDA of $590 million to $600 million, above our prior guidance of $580 million to $590 million, and that incorporates increased investment into more product innovation, new businesses, services and member benefits. This represents 15% to 17% adjusted net revenue growth and a 25% adjusted EBITDA margin.
 We now expect full year GAAP net income of $165 million to $175 million, above prior guidance of $95 million to $105 million, which includes a $59 million gain associated with the convertible note exchange. We expect fully diluted GAAP EPS of $0.08 to $0.09 per share above prior guidance of $0.07 to $0.08 per share.
 We now expect growth in tangible book value of approximately $800 million to $1 billion for the year versus our previous guidance of $300 million to $500 million, given the benefits of the recent convertible debt exchange, along with the effects of new convertible issuance. We now expect to end the year, with a total capital ratio of north of 16% due to those transactions versus our previous guidance of 14%.
 We continue to expect to add at least 2.3 million new members in 2024, which represents 30% growth. For Q2, we expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $555 million to $565 million, adjusted EBITDA of $115 million to $125 million, and net income of $5 million to $10 million.
 In terms of phasing, you can see for the past 2 years that the second quarter is seasonally flattish for lending, which coupled with our more conservative approach toward originations this year should drive a sequential decline in lending revenue, which largely offsets tailwinds in the 2 other segments.
 In terms of operating expenses, you can expect low single-digit sequential growth as we continue to invest in future growth. Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Q1 results and continued progress.
 Having delivered over $581 million of adjusted net revenue and $144 million of adjusted EBITDA, we continue to make great progress against our long-term objectives in the quarter and remain very well capitalized to achieve our vision of making SoFi the one-stop shop for digital financial services.
 With that, let's begin the Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Hecht of Jefferies. 
John Hecht: Chris, you gave some of the metrics in the personal lending book on charge-offs and so forth. I'm wondering, what you're looking at, at this point in terms of payment trends and kind of the underwriting factors that informs your credit outlook? And maybe if you could give us your thoughts on that as well. 
Chris Lapointe: Sure. I'll start and then Anthony can chime in. So we feel really good about our credit and the underlying performance of our loans, and everything is performing in line with expectations, while we continue to see the underlying signs of improvement.
 In Q1, our net charge-off rate was 3.45%, which was down from 4.0% in Q4, which included the impact of asset sales, new originations as well as the delinquency sale that we did in the quarter.
 In terms of our outlook, we anticipate ongoing normalization in credit performance towards pre-pandemic levels of 7% to 8% life of loan losses, which is in line with what we said last quarter.
 Historically, life of loan losses could reasonably be approximated by the weighted average life of the portfolio, multiplied by a given quarter's annualized net charge-offs. However, while our life of loan loss trends and our outlook are unchanged, the relationship to any given quarter's NCOs has changed.
 In fact, what we're now seeing, particularly with how recent vintages are playing out, is a more rapid factoring down of loan principal, as a result of increasing prepayment rates and demand for shorter-term loans.
 What that means is that we're starting to see a greater proportion of losses happening sooner. And as a result, we're seeing an outsized impact on NCO rates that are not directly correlated to the life of loan losses when applying the normal 1.5x weighted average life to them.
 In other words, for any specific recent vintage, you can expect to see losses lower in the latter stages than before and higher in the earlier stages. However, our life of loan losses will remain in line with our 7% to 8% outlook.
 What gives us confidence in that 7% to 8% outlook is that we have a decade of experience of underwriting high-quality credit, and as we've been talking about for quite some time, optimizing the credit profile of those we underwrite to is part of our DNA.
 We underwrite to cash flow. We have very robust analytics, detailed vintage-based models and forecasts, which are managed by our second line of defense. And all of our outlooks are data-driven, resulting in the strong performance and outcomes that we've been able to achieve.
 Now when looking at some of the specific numbers and trends that we're observing today, we've seen a material improvement in performance since we started tightening credit in mid-2022.
 When looking at recent vintages and their loss rates at comparable points in time to our Q3 2022 vintage, we've observed the following: in Q1 -- our Q1 2023 cumulative vintage losses through 12 months of being on the books was approximately 20% better than the Q3 2022 vintage over that same period of time, 12 months of being on the books.
 If you look at our Q2 2023 cumulative vintage losses through 9 months of being on the books, that was also 20% better than the Q3 (sic) [ Q2 ] 2022 vintage over the same period of time. And then finally, our Q3 2023 cumulative vintage losses through 6 months of being on the books was nearly 40% better than the Q3 2022 vintage over the same period of time.
 So putting it all together, the performance improvement that we've observed in recent vintages, coupled with the short duration nature of the assets and the remaining principal on older and newer vintages prior to making credit cuts gives us a very high degree of confidence in our 7% to 8% life of loan loss outlook. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark DeVries of Deutsche Bank. 
Mark DeVries: Yes. I was curious whether just kind of given where you are now with the equity capital levels whether you feel you have enough sources to support future growth? Or do you potentially see yourself having to raise additional outside equity? 
Anthony Noto: Thanks for the question. We had significant excess capital prior to the transactions that occurred in the quarter. Our risk-based capital level was -- over 15%. It's now over 17%, well, well, well above our regulatory department. And given our outlook on lending, there's no reason for us to change our stance in that business.
 We have -- we went into 2024 with a view that our growth would be driven by the combined impact of Tech Platform and Financial Services business. Those businesses are now big enough in terms of total scale and profitable enough. I would put our resources behind them, still grow as we did this quarter over 26% year-over-year, while the lending business was essentially flat year-over-year.
 So our decision to make that transition in 2024, wasn't driven by capital. We had excess capital and could grow it much faster. We have even more excess capital now, but our stance hasn't changed because that wasn't the reason for keeping it relatively conservative. We feel great about the trends in Tech Platform and Financial Services. I think it's quite remarkable, the growth rate that we're achieving there and the level of profitability.
 If you had asked me 6 years ago, could we deliver in the first quarter of 2024, a 25% revenue growth, 25% EBITDA margin, growth in tangible book about 16% sequentially in addition to record deposits and strong member growth of 44%, with lending being flat, I would have said not a chance.
 So it's a real testament to the diversification of our business and the optionality we have to drive growth in different environments. But we started in October, talking about higher for longer. And while the market and different government officials let people to believe there'd be 6 rate cuts at one point. Now we're down to 1 to 2 rate cuts. We think we took the appropriate stance, and we're well positioned to play where the economy goes in 2024. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Dolev of Mizuho. 
Dan Dolev: Really strong results, congrats. I have a question about the NIM. Really stable NIM trends. Can you, Chris comment on the future NIM trends, how you're seeing them? I would appreciate it. 
Chris Lapointe: Sure. Thanks, Dan. So yes, we've been very successful in maintaining healthy net interest margins and continuing to expand them over time. In Q1, our net interest margin was 5.9%, which was up 43 basis points year-over-year. And more importantly, what we've seen is year-over-year net interest margin expansion in every single quarter throughout 2022 and 2023.
 Our ability to constantly expand NIM was a function of maintaining loan pricing betas that are above 100% in a rising rate environment, scaling our high-quality deposits and maintaining betas below 100% in a rising rate environment for our loans business, as well as capital structure optimization moves that provide us with a lower cost of funding.
 We do expect to maintain healthy margins for the foreseeable future, breaking it down between the asset side and the liability side. On the asset side of the equation, in a higher for longer rate environment, we do expect to maintain strong yields north of 9%, which is consistent with what we've observed over the course of the last several quarters, even in light of seeing a mix shift away from personal loans on the balance sheet.
 And then on the liability side, we expect to be able to maintain a healthy cost of funding even while maintaining a highly competitive APY on our SoFi Money product. That's a function of a few things. First, we recently issued $862.5 million of convertible notes at a rate of 1.25%, which was used to displace much higher cost of funding.
 Second, we still have room to fund more of our balance sheet with lower cost deposits. We have $2.6 billion of higher cost brokered CDs, $800 million of warehouse lines that are outstanding and about $500 million of a corporate revolver outstanding.
 So net-net, we're really confident in being able to maintain net interest margins above 5% for the foreseeable future. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kyle Peterson of Needham & Company. 
Kyle Peterson: Great. Just wanted to dive a bit more into deposit growth and pricing, obviously been really strong growth on that front. But if you could give a little more detail, specially on deposit betas and what the biggest drivers of growth will be -- particularly if we are in a higher for longer environment, that would be great? 
Anthony Noto: Yes. Chris can comment on the betas. What I'd say is we raised our '24 revenue outlook in terms of the range by more than we'd be in Q1. That's because of the positive tailwinds we're seeing in both Tech Platform as well as Financial Services. We had record growth in deposits in Q1 of $3 billion. We've seen really strong debit spending trends. We're annualizing more than $8 billion now.
 So that will definitely continue to have a tailwind. We're uniquely positioned to be able to provide an attractive APY on the deposit business. Given the fact that we're an originator, and we can match up what we're lending at versus what we're paying out from a depository standpoint.
 In addition to that, we've really seen strong trends from the existing customers for the Tech Platform business. In addition to uptake of new products such as payment risk platform as well as the Konecta chatbot product. So we feel good about the largest components of our revenue going to the back half of the year.
 And then we have the additional contributions from businesses like SoFi Invest as well as our Credit Card business and efforts that we had with Lantern and small, medium business lead generation. Those are all contributing smaller dollar amounts, but moving quite strongly in a direction of continuing tailwind as well. 
Chris Lapointe: And then from a beta perspective, we ended up exiting the quarter with $21.6 billion of deposits. That was up $3 billion quarter-over-quarter with more than 90% of the deposits coming from direct deposit members.
 We ended up launching the Checking and Savings product back in February of 2022 with an APY of 1%. And then at the end of Q1, our APY is 4.6%. So our overall beta over the course of time that has been in the 65% to 70% range. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Reggie Smith of JPMorgan. 
Reginald Smith: I wanted to kind of dig into the Financial Services segment a little bit. One of the disclosures you guys given in the press release is the FICO score of some of your new depositors. I guess my question is, what's your appetite for really growing the Credit Card business. And maybe talk about like what that looks like ultimately growing that?
 And then my second question, which is related to Financial Services is at what point would, I guess, interest from Credit Card outweigh maybe some of the transfer pricing that you get it from the lending segment. Is that an ultimate goal where that business is driven more by the actual lending of the Credit Card business? If that makes sense. 
Anthony Noto: We're really excited about where we are with Credit Card. We've had a great journey in launching a credit card, learning quite a bit about our go-to-market strategy, how we're marketing and targeting potential new members with credit card in addition to understanding the underlying credit trends and what the right credit model is, in addition to other factors like fraud and risk overall.
 We've brought in significant subject matter expertise in the Credit Card business that have actually built new prime cards in the past. Our product remains a prime product that will continue to be a prime product. But we felt like coming out of 2023, that we had the learnings that allow us to be more aggressive in 2024 in that business as things unfold. So expect us to invest more in the business and see some good innovation in the back half of the year, based on the learnings that we've had for the last 3 years.
 It's a great product. It has a high ROE product, but there is a J curve that you have to go through. I think one of the things that may often be missed by the broader investment community is that now we have 8.1 million members, we can market our credit card to known members with known credit profiles, known spending capabilities, cash flow, capacity, et cetera.
 And so we're at that point now where we would really like to put more resources behind the strides that we think is really working in our benefit as it relates to the interest rate and the relationship to the rest of our funding costs and what presents to that. 
Chris Lapointe: Yes. So right now, this is a super high ROE business. And in terms of the mix shift towards the lending product. We still have significant low cost of funding, but through our deposit base, and as Anthony mentioned, we're going to start scaling this business more rapidly. We had started to see some good green shoots in terms of early-stage delinquencies and losses that are performing materially better than historical vintages, so we can start investing more heavily in this business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Christiansen of Citigroup. 
Peter Christiansen: Great to be on the call. I'm curious about network fees in the Financial Services segment, which were down quarter over quarter. I'm just -- I think the expectation there was that they would rise sequentially. Just if you can give a little bit of color there. 
Chris Lapointe: Yes, absolutely. So we are seeing really good spend behavior. We had about $1.9 billion of overall spend in the quarter. That was up from $1.5 billion in Q4 and $1.2 billion in Q3 of last year. We did benefit from a small onetime benefit from a partner on the network fee side. But what you can expect going forward is relatively linear growth with spend behavior over the course of 2024. So there was a one-timer in Q4 that made for a tough comp, but going forward, you can think of linear growth or relative to spend. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Adelson of Morgan Stanley. 
Jeffrey Adelson: Chris, maybe just to circle back on the improvement in the charge-off rate for personal loans. Seems like we saw a 15% sequential decline there, sort of in line with the comments you've made about the 15% of credits coming out of the system over the last quarter and in this quarter.
 How long should we maybe expect that to persist? I know you're still talking about the charge-off rates normalizing towards your life of loan targets. Just kind of curious how that short-term dynamic might play out?
 And then I guess the comments on keeping your excess capital this year in light of the macro uncertainty. Are you hearing anything from your regulators on there about any sort of buffer you might need to keep? Have you tried to run an excess capital drawdown scenario from an internal stress test? Or have you ever tried to size that. Just kind of curious because it seems like the macro uncertainty is a bit at odds with what we're hearing from other lenders, which are pointing to a little bit more of a stable to improving macro. Just trying to understand why maybe you wouldn't lean in a little bit more on the personal loan side here. 
Chris Lapointe: Yes, sure. I'll take some of the losses. Anthony can hit on some of the excess capital. On the losses front, we did see a decline in net charge-offs, but what's important is the net charge-off rate is a function of a number of factors. It's originations in the period, it's pay downs. It's a term of the loans that we're underwriting to.
 We did benefit in this period from the late-stage delinquency sale that we did, which helped drive the overall losses down sequentially. What I would guide you to is that 7% to 8% life of loan loss outlook, which we feel extremely confident in given some of the loss trends and delinquency trends that we're seeing in our more recent 2023 vintages on the excess capital point. 
Anthony Noto: Yes. So what I'd say is we 100% have the option to drive the lending business faster if we'd like. We do stress tests, as you would imagine internally and externally for others across the entire ecosystem, which we operate. And starting the year at the risk-based capital that we had at 15% -- with stress test gave us ample opportunity to invest in that business at a rate that we wanted to.
 I would say our outlook for the lending business is more reflective of the uncertainty as opposed to whether or not there are great trends. As you see in our lending business is actually performing quite well. We're driving great returns there, good steady credit performance as expected.
 It's not that we're expecting a huge drop off the cliff or huge deterioration. It's that we've gone from in the last 6 months, the market anticipating 6 rate cuts as you got into the sort of October time period to then now, we're down to 1 to 2 rate cuts. And prior to the 6 rate cuts, people were talking about higher for longer in October. And so there's been a complete swing of the interest rate environment.
 As you just saw in the banking industry, that creates liquidity issues for different banks. We're concerned about others not being able to manage the liquidity issues. Last year, at this time, we were experiencing First Republic going under that was not anticipated.
 I don't know what's around the next quarter. I do know that we have a great member base. We have excess capital well above we started the year with at 17%. So we have the option to grow the business much faster we choose to.
 And one of the things we haven't talked about is we're now selling a significant amount of loans. We sold 1.9 billion of loans in the quarter. That demand remains strong. And so to the extent that, that demand continues to increase and remain strong, and the environment remains sort of stable and more predictable.
 Could we be more aggressive in the lending business? 100%. We have the capital. We have the go-to-market strategy. We have the flexibility on the balance sheet, and we have the opportunity to be able to do it. We're just taking a very conservative view to make sure; we don't go into an environment that we're completely unprepared for. Taking a conservative stance gives us the most optionality to do work, but not necessarily have to do less. 
Chris Lapointe: Yes. And the only other thing I would add to quantify some of those numbers in terms of our overall capacity is that we have more than $20 billion in capacity to originate loans. And even though we're -- even if we were to originate at that level, we would remain well above all regulatory minimums.
 In terms of what's driving the overall $20 billion; first, we expect to generate $800 million to $1 billion of tangible book value in 2024, which translates to about $6.5 billion to $8 billion of incremental capacity; second, loans are amortizing or paying down at the annual rate of $9.5 billion; third, we have our previously announced $2 billion forward flow agreement in addition to a number of on-the-run transactions that we're doing in the capital markets front. Demand is extremely strong. We did $1.9 billion of sales this past quarter.
 And then lastly, we have incremental headroom in our overall capital ratio. So having said that, we have sufficient capacity, but we are taking a conservative approach. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. 
Mihir Bhatia: I wanted to switch to the Tech Segment for a second. You had 20% account growth this quarter. I was wondering if you could comment on a couple of things there. One is, can you just comment on what's driving that? Maybe talk about some of the key customers you may be added in the quarter.
 Also just curious if you could provide some examples of the larger clients you have won since transitioning the sales strategy to focus on these large clients? And then just relatively on the segment, margins improved nicely. Just -- and I think you've talked about this being a margin expansion year. But can you just comment on the margin trajectory from here? 
Anthony Noto: Yes. In terms of the Tech Platform, we saw good consistent trends there. The Tech Platform grew 21%, which was an acceleration and year-over-year growth compared to Q4 and Q3 and Q4 also accelerated. We expect the trends there to continue. We have a really sizable client base with growing of underlying users in that client base in addition to driving additional product attachments to our existing clients. We're also seeing a greater contribution from new clients over the last 9 months.
 As it relates to the broader macro environment for Technology Platform segment, the demand interest in using our technology platform, our modern Gen 3 core as well as our API-based payment platform, issuing platform is as high as it's ever been. And we continue to sign up new partners. I'd say those new partners fall into a couple of buckets. We are converting people from other competitive processing sites to Galileo. In addition to that, there's a lot of demand still from partners that haven't historically used an issuing platform or processing platform like Galileo that are transitioning to that platform from a sector standpoint.
 1and then in the large fund institutions, the demand for modern cores and processing continues to be really robust. The timing on those deals is really driven by those end customers. We haven't lost any of the RFPs. We've continued to be down selected as big [ process ] institutions go from a large RFP to a few select partners. So we feel good about our chances there.
 We're not expecting to win 100% of those deals, but we feel like we can win our fair share. Those deals will take longer to not only sign up, but to also implement. And so the contribution for that is quarters, not months, after they're announced, but we feel great about the current trends there, and that's why the acceleration happened in the quarter.
 Q2 is a seasonally weaker quarter for the Technology Platform business, but the year-over-year growth rates what people should focus on because that eliminates the impact of seasonality and that accelerated. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Terry Ma of Barclays. 
Terry Ma: I just wanted to dig a little bit more on the late-stage personal loan -- delinquency personal loan sales. Can you maybe just talk about the structure and execution around that and whether or not you plan on selling more? 
Chris Lapointe: Yes, absolutely. So in Q1, we ended up selling $62.5 million of late-stage delinquent personal loans in the quarter. Typically, we do not sell delinquent loans until they are charged off, but we were able to generate an opportunity where we're able to generate positive value relative to letting the loans charge off and sell after the fact.
 So typically, how it works at a high level is we would normally let a loan charge-off, and then sell and release servicing to a debt settlement company or another investor for low double-digit pennies on the dollar. In this late-stage delinquency sales structure, we were able to retain servicing and portions of the recovery, which will result in nearly double the returns, we would have otherwise been able to achieve. 
Operator: Our final question comes from Jill Shea of UBS. 
Jill Glaser Shea: So I just wanted to touch on operating expenses. And just wondering if you could highlight any opportunities there, and the largest efficiency gain areas? And then also, how does continued brand awareness improvement impact your sales and marketing spend? 
Chris Lapointe: Yes. So I'll hit on some of the operating expense lines. I'll let Anthony hit on the brand awareness.
 But overall, we saw a meaningful improvements across all functional expense line items. Sales and marketing, specifically, was down about 900 basis points year-over-year as a result of obviously improvements in overall brand awareness, continued and elevated cross buy. We're close to 40% of all new products that were taken out in the period, but were coming from existing members on the platform. And then we're just getting much more efficient at being able to market.
 In terms of other efficiencies, we continue to see efficiencies in R&D as a result of the migration from being on-prem to the cloud in our Tech Platform business, as well as other investments that we've made over the course of the years that are starting to play out.
 On the operations side, we're seeing meaningful leverage as a result of some of the automation efforts that we've invested in over the course of the last 24 months, which, again, are starting to play out as we're seeing better funnel conversion and improvement.
 And then in G&A, as you would expect, there's meaningful operating leverage in the system as we continue to scale. We made significant investments as we became a public company and got our bank charter, and also invested heavily in risk in second and third lines of defense, and as those investments were made over the course of the last 12 to 24 months at scale.
 I'll turn it over to Anthony to hit on the brand piece. 
Anthony Noto: Yes. On the brand awareness side, we're really pleased with just the continued improvement we have in unaided brand awareness. Our marketing team and our businesses have done a great job of putting together a very integrated multimedia strategy that leverages partnerships with big well-known brands that help us achieve brand unaided awareness to become a household brand name.
 That helps improve our overall performance marketing as well. The more people that know us, the more people that trust us, the better reaction we get from every offer we have in the marketplace or other ways that we connect with potential new members in addition to building their awareness of new products beyond their initial product.
 Our cross-buying continues to remain really strong. We're seeing good financial service productivity leverage in our customer acquisition costs. So it's been a great year and 2024 is off to a great start as it relates to the impact on our unaided brand awareness from things like our recent partnership with the NBA as the official bank of the National Basketball Association. 
Chris Lapointe: With that, let me add some concluding remarks. I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We're proud to kick off 2024 with an exceptionally strong first quarter. Our 26% revenue growth driven by 54% growth in revenue from the combined Tech Platform and Financial Services, which now constitutes 42% of revenue, while no growth in lending gives us a very strong outlook for the year, with 25% EBITDA margins in the quarter and for the full year, record $3 billion of deposit growth and 16% growth in tangible book value and 44% growth in members, now totaling 8.1 million in total are a great testament to the success of our bold strategy and ability to execute across an unprecedented set of financial conditions over the last 6 years.
 Although we live in an unpredictable world, our team at SoFi is resolved to serve the needs of more than 8 million members and clients, while sustaining the growth, profitability and increase in the shareholder value that we've done so far. We thank you for your interest and look forward to talking to you next quarter. 
Paulina Gutierrez: Goodbye.

2024,Q2,2024-07-30,"Operator: Good morning. My name is Adam, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the SoFi Technologies Q2 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. With that, you may begin your conference.
Maura Cyr: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to SoFi's second quarter of 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results and recent events are Anthony Noto, CEO, and Chris Lapointe, CFO. You can find the presentation accompanying our earnings release on the Investor Relations section of our website. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations and forecasts and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, our competitive advantage and strategy, macroeconomic conditions and outlook, future products and services, and future business and financial performance. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are described in today's press release and our subsequent filings made with the SEC, including our upcoming Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Anthony.
Anthony Noto: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results were exceptional and continue to demonstrate SoFi's leadership as a one-stop shop for digital financial services and the amazing grit of our team. I'll cover five topics before turning to Chris for a deeper look at our financial and operating performance. First, our strategy continues to drive strong diversified growth, profitability and returns. Second, our continuous product innovation and brand-building are fueling significant member and product growth, which are key to our long-term revenue and profit growth outlooks. Third, turning to our segment results, our Financial Services segment demonstrates our clear structural advantages in delivering value to members. Fourth, our leadership and agility in lending has generated sustained returns despite rising rates and positions us to move quickly once rates come down. And finally, our tech platform is making good progress on its journey toward becoming an AWS of not only to fintech but of financial services broadly. Turning to the first topic, the success of our one-stop shop strategy. For Q2, adjusted net revenue reached a new record of $597 million, a 22% year-over-year increase. Our rapid diversification made a record revenue quarter possible even with just 5% growth in adjusted net revenue in lending. Combined, Financial Services and Tech Platform revenue grew 46% year-over-year and now makes up 45% of total adjusted net revenue, up from 38% one year ago. To put that accomplishment in context, lending now stands at just 57% of adjusted net revenue compared to 99% of our revenue when I joined nearly seven years ago and more than 70% of revenue just two years ago. We also delivered even greater growth and profitability in the quarter. EBITDA grew 80% year-over-year to $138 million. We recorded our third consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability with $17 million in GAAP net income versus a loss of $40 million in Q2 of 2023. Credit performance was better-than-expected as cumulative fair-value adjustments from delinquent loans peaked in March along with delinquencies on an absolute and percentage basis. We are really encouraged by our team's ability to bend the curves through stringent underwriting, limiting credit exposure when prudent and improving collections and servicing. Chris will share details on the performance of our recent personal loan vintages, which show clear improvements versus older vintages, underscoring our confidence in our prior guidance around left-alone losses peaking in the 7% to 8% range. Our loan sales continue to scale at attractive execution levels with an increasingly diversified set of buyers with $1.6 billion in total sales this quarter and $4.7 billion in the three trailing quarters. This brings me to my second topic. Our rapid pace of innovation and brand-building are fueling significant member and product growth. The growing size of our member base and the number of products they use impact the results we're reporting today. But more importantly, they are the leading indicators of our potential revenue growth and profitability in the future. In Q2, we added 643,000 members and now have 8.8 million in total. That's up 41% year-over-year. We grew products in the quarter by 946,000 to 12.8 million in total. That's up 43% year-over-year, adjusting for our exit from crypto last year. Nearly 40% of all new products in Q2 were opened by existing SoFi members. We also see that nearly 30% of new members opened a second product in the first 30 days, demonstrating the immediate value of our one-stop shop strategy. We've doubled our member base and number of products in the past two years and Q2 was the 20th consecutive quarter of greater than 30% growth. Our growth in members and products will drive our financial growth for years to come and is the basis for our three-year financial outlook shared at the end of 2023. All this growth is a direct result of our relentless focus on innovation because we offer products across eight categories compared to many fintechs that only offer one or two, the magnitude of our innovation is not always obvious. As much as I'd love to share the full breadth of what we shipped in the quarter, I'll just cover a few of the highlights. I'll start with our Financial Services business, which drove 91% of our new product adds in the quarter. Our Invest offering is getting better every day. In fact, I don't know of any other self-directed product that offers alternative assets like private credit, private real estate and private venture investing side-by-side with fractional shares, robo finds, ETFs and IPOs. Our innovations over the last year are starting to accelerate results, driving a 58% year-over-year increase in assets under management in our Invest business in Q2, and this was driven largely by net flows. We fully rolled out alternative assets and mutual funds, including interval funds from well-known financial leaders in KKR, Carlisle, Franklin Templeton and ARK Venture Fund, which includes several leading private technology companies. Alternative assets generated 12% of all net flows during the second quarter. We brought the concept of one-click checkout to individual asset transfers, enabling our members to consolidate their assets the way they would like and now we're seeing benefits from that innovation as well. We are now finalizing a turnkey way for companies going public to extend participation in their IPOs at scale to their customers, employees and partners. With this new directed share program, people can open an account, enter an order and fund it in minutes without fees, minimum balances or speaking to anyone in order to participate in an IPO. Turning to SoFi Money. In the quarter, we launched Zelle, one of our most requested features and one element of our much larger money movement product pipeline. The innovations in our member business unit, which focused on ensuring our products work better when used together are reaching critical mass. For example, 3 million members have signed up for SoFi's broad-based rewards program. We're creating a rewards economy across our products, including rewards for using our app and other services and we're expanding redemption options including into stocks, cash for savings and travel. For SoFi Plus, we achieved 1 million members. For people that are not familiar with SoFi Plus, it is our premium membership tier available to those who enable direct deposit. SoFi Plus includes our highest APY on banking balances which today is up to 4.6%. It also includes up to 2x reward points, up to 3.3% cashback rewards on SoFi Credit spending, discounts on personal loan rates and much more. And I'm very excited to share that we've laid the foundation to provide more value in SoFi Plus not only to direct deposit members but also a monthly paid subscription product for those who prefer that option over direct deposit. We intend to test this new subscription-based option for SoFi Plus later this year. We're also driving iteration and learning to drive innovation in credit cards. We've improved our acquisition capabilities and introduced a 10% cashback boost for SoFi Plus members that has shown positive results. And I'm excited to share that this week we'll also begin testing two new credit cards to better serve our members' needs, one card for cashback rewards on everyday high-spending categories and one for members who need a no-frills card with no surprise fees. Turning to Lending. We've launched new capabilities that position us for future growth, especially as the rate environment improves. In small and medium business, members can now apply for a loan at SoFi and get approved offers from lending partners. In Home Loans, we can now close our home equity products instead of brokering them out. This dramatically increases our potential for revenue per loan. Notably, we're now a principal in home equity loans and can offer members a lower cost of borrowing in these secured loans compared to higher rates in unsecured lending. And of course, our Tech Platform is a center of innovation as we add capabilities to our already comprehensive offering. We expanded our Buy Now Pay Later product for post-purchase use. We added new wire capabilities and extended the AI-driven transactional fraud capabilities in our payment risk platform to non-processing partners. We also advanced the quality of our managed service in the cloud and introduced 3DS, which adds another layer of security to digital card transactions. These improvements ensure our modern cloud-based platform will continue to serve the needs of brands, fintechs and global financial institutions alike. Having world-class products is a necessary factor in becoming a Top 10 financial institution, but it's not enough. We must also become a trusted household brand name. We measure this by our unaided brand awareness. Our world-class marketing team stands in a category of one. Their amazing work has increased unaided brand awareness to the 7% to 9% range which is up about 40% year-over-year and 4x since 2021. Our brand punches way above its weight as our team continues to make its footprint bigger than its foot. Now diving into our segment results. In Financial Services segment, we are seeing the continued benefits of structural advantages that drive our leading value proposition. We reported record segment revenue of $176 million, up 80% from $98 million in the year ago quarter. Importantly, this drove contribution profit of $55 million compared to a loss of $4 million one year earlier. Financial Services products grew $865,000 in the quarter, up 48% year-over-year, adjusting for our exit from crypto last year. Revenue per product grew 8% quarter-over-quarter and 29% year-over-year. We believe there is substantial upside to the monetization of our financial services products. SoFi Money achieved new records this quarter as ending deposits totaled $23 billion with consumer deposits up $2.2 billion from the previous quarter. Account openings grew by $419,000 and 90% of our deposits remain tied to sticky direct deposit relationships. Debit spend also continues to increase at a rapid pace, up 129% year-over-year and now annualizing at about $9 billion. Our Credit Card and Invest businesses remain in investment mode with nearly $100 million in annualized losses, but we expect them to follow a similar path to Money in achieving variable profit and contribution profit. In our Credit Card business, delinquency entry rates and roll rates improved by roughly 20% apiece from 2023 averages. Turning now to my fourth topic, our strong leadership across lending. We reported strong results despite our conservative posture given a 500 basis point increase in benchmark rates over the past two years and continued macro uncertainty. Importantly, net interest income reached an all-time high of $279 million or 82% of lending revenue versus 72% one year ago and 45% two years ago. Net interest income is cash revenue. Let me say that again, net interest income is cash revenue, so 82% of our lending revenue is cash. Notably, discount rates and spreads were largely unchanged and in aggregate had a slight negative impact on lending revenue. Our personal loan originations reached a record of $4.2 billion while sticking to stringent underwriting standards as our team demonstrated its grip by consistently iterating on pricing and marketing throughout the quarter. Our home loan originations were their highest since Q1 of 2022, growing 24% quarter-over-quarter and 71% year-over-year despite interest rates at their highest level in 10 quarters. On top of that, purchase home loan volume was our highest ever, growing 25% from Q1 2024 and nearly 100% year-over-year. Once rates come down, we expect to benefit from our expansion into three products in home lending, purchase loans, home equity loans and the volume already generated by our financing business. Student loan originations grew 86% year-over-year. The team drove our strongest Q2 of origination volume in three years by iterating to drive continuous improvement throughout the quarter and into Q3 with private loan refinancing, which exemplifies our ability to respond to environmental factors to drive results. And my fifth topic, the Tech Platforms segment is making good progress on its journey to become not only the AWS of fintech but of financial services more broadly. We recorded segment revenue of $95 million, up 9% year-over-year and contribution profit of $31 million, up 82% year-over-year at a 33% margin. This represents our fourth consecutive quarter of over 30% margin. Our customer wins have been more diverse, including but not limited to, secure card and B2B partners. Our pipeline of interest remains robust and includes US and international financial institutions along with major consumer and commercial brands. As we have noted, we are pursuing enterprise partnerships with larger existing customer bases for more durable revenue opportunities. These partnerships take multiple quarters, not months to win and have even longer integration cycles due to their size and complexity. In closing, the quarter was exceptional. We continue to demonstrate a record of strong diversified growth even in uncertain times. The performance of our leaders and the grittiness of our team was the best I've seen in my seven years here. Suffice it to say, I cannot wait to see what we achieve in a better climate. Combining our high member growth and product innovation with lower benchmark rates, unemployment at 4% to 5%, stable inflation and a stable economy, I could not be more confident in our ability to achieve our ambitions. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris for a deeper look at the results.
Chris Lapointe: Thanks, Anthony. The second quarter was underscored by continued execution, profitability and increased diversification, strong evidence of how our differentiated business model drives SoFi's durability and long-term growth potential. I'm going to walk through key financial highlights and our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the second quarter of 2024 versus second quarter of 2023. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-Q filing, which will be made available next month. For the quarter, we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $597 million, which grew 22% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $138 million at a 23% margin. This represented over 7 points of year-over-year margin improvement, demonstrating significant operating leverage. In fact, sales and marketing declined as a percentage of adjusted net revenue by 6 points relative to the year-ago quarter. We delivered our third quarter GAAP profitability with GAAP net income reaching $17.4 million, a $65 million improvement year-over-year and GAAP EPS of $0.01 per share. Now, on to the segment-level performance. In Lending, we achieved adjusted net revenue of $339 million with $198 million of contribution profit at a 58% margin. These results were driven by 20% year-over-year growth in net interest income, while non-interest income was down 38% as planned. Growth in net interest income was driven by a 40% year-over-year increase in average interest earning assets and a 27 basis point year-over-year increase in average yields. This resulted in an average net interest margin of 5.83% for the quarter, up 9 basis points year-over-year. In terms of non-interest income, Q2 originations grew 22% year-over-year to $5.3 billion and were driven by a record quarter in personal loan originations, which grew 12% year-over-year and 28% sequentially to $4.2 billion. Our student loans business saw origination volume grow 86% year-over-year with a slight 2% decline sequentially to $737 million. Home loans grew by 71% year-over-year and 24% sequentially to $417 million. Our personal loan borrowers' weighted average income is $168,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 747. Our student loan borrowers' weighted average income is $137,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 764. In the second quarter, we sold portions of our personal loan and home loan portfolios totaling nearly $1.6 billion. In terms of the personal loan sales, we closed $1.1 billion of principal at a blended execution of 106.2%. These sales had similar structures to other recent personal loan sales with cash proceeds in line with par or at a small premium to par with the majority of the execution premium consisting of a contractual servicing fee that is capitalized. These deals included a small loss share provision that is above our base assumption of losses and immaterial relative to the exposure we would otherwise have if we held the loans. Our $381 million of home loan sales were sold at a blended execution of 101.9%. Additionally, we sold $69 million of late-stage delinquent personal loans in the quarter. We noted last quarter that we typically have not sold delinquent loans until such time that they are charged off. However, we've been able to generate positive incremental value in these sales relative to selling after they charge off, both from our improved recovery capabilities and by maintaining servicing. Finally, we executed $989 million of senior secured financing, which will show up on our detailed balance sheet as senior secured loans held for investment at amortized costs. These loans have a fixed-term structure and are secured against the underlying assets, therefore equivalent to investment-grade bonds if you were to do a securitization for the same pool of collateral. In addition, these loans are priced at market rates which not only helps to diversify our balance sheet but also provides an additional return above our cost of funding and a yield similar to the net interest margin of our loans which are unsecured. Turning to credit performance. Our on balance sheet 90-day personal loan delinquency rate was 64 basis points in the quarter, a decrease from 72 basis points in Q1 which is evidence of surpassing a peak. Our personal loan annualized charge-off rate increased to 3.84% from 3.45% in Q1 2024, including the impact of asset sales, new originations and the delinquency sale in the quarter. Had we not sold these late-stage delinquencies, we estimate that including recoveries between 90 days and 120 days delinquent, we would have had an all-in annualized net charge-off for personal loans of approximately 5.4%. For our student loans, our on balance sheet 90-day delinquency rate was 12 basis points versus 13 basis points last quarter, while our annualized loan charge-off rate was 64 basis points. That brings me to an important point, an in-depth look at cumulative net losses on several of our personal loan vintages and how this underscores comfort in our 7% to 8% maximum life of loan loss assumptions in line with our underwriting tolerance. As you can see on Page 8 of our investor presentation, a loan vintage analysis indicates the following. Using our 2017 vintage as a starting point as this is the last that approached 8% life of loan losses at 7.85%, you can see significant improvement in cumulative net losses at a given percentage of remaining unpaid principal for more recent 2022 and 2023 vintages. Specifically looking at the Q4 2022 vintage, soon after we made material cuts to credit, at roughly 40% of remaining unpaid principal, net cumulative losses of 5.02% are well below the 6.07% observed in the 2017 vintage at that same point of 40% remaining principal balance. In addition, you can see that more recent vintages are performing as well or better than the Q4 2022 loans at similar levels of remaining unpaid principal. This is critically important as this analysis and comparison gives us confidence that our loans will continue to perform in line to better than our tolerance. Furthermore, looking at Page 9 in the investor presentation, you will notice that only 44% of unpaid principal remains from our Q1 2020 through Q1 2024 originations. Among the 56% of principal that has already been paid down, we've seen only 3% in net cumulative losses. For life of loan losses on this entire cohort of loans to reach 8% net cumulative losses, the remaining unpaid principal would need to charge off at a rate of 11%. Past vintages have performed meaningfully better after this point in the seasoning curve, further improving our confidence in achieving loss rates below 8%. Now turning to our fair value marks and key assumptions. Our personal loans are marked at 104.3%, 5 basis points higher quarter-over-quarter with a negligible change in the discount rate. For our student loan portfolio, the fair value mark decreased by 17 basis points to 103.6%, while the discount rate rose by 10 basis points to 4.44% due to rising rates and a wider spread. Overall, sequential changes in spreads and discount rates had a negative impact on reported revenue. Moving on to Financial Services where net revenue of $176 million increased 80% year-over-year with new all-time high revenue for SoFi Money in our loan platform business as well as continued contributions from SoFi Invest and Credit Card. Overall monetization continues to improve with annualized revenue per product of $64, up nearly 29% year-over-year versus $50 in Q2 2023. This is driven by higher deposits and member spending levels in SoFi Money, greater assets under management and monetizable features in SoFi Invest and robust growth within SoFi Credit Card spend. Net interest income of $139 million increased 87% year-over-year which was primarily driven by growth in consumer deposits. Importantly, non-interest income grew 58% to $37 million in the quarter which represents approximately $150 million in annualized revenue. This was driven by interchange growth of 67% year-over-year as a result of over $10 billion in total annualized spend, as well as our referrals from our loan platform business, which grew 66% versus the prior year period. Contribution profit reached $55 million at a 31% margin for the quarter, even as we continue to invest in innovation and new opportunities to rapidly grow this operating segment with attractive returns. Lastly, we reached 11 million financial services products in the quarter, which is up 39% year-over-year with 865,000 new products in the quarter. We reached nearly 4.3 million products in SoFi Money, 2.3 million in SoFi Invest and 3.9 million in Relay. Shifting to our Tech Platform segment where we delivered net revenue of $95 million in the quarter, up 9% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance from new clients onboarded over the last four quarters along with strong monetization of existing clients on our platform. Galileo accounts grew 23% year-over-year to 158 million. The segment delivered a contribution profit of $31 million, representing a 33% margin. We continue to leverage investments made in the segment as we continue to position Tech Platform for higher rates of diversified durable growth going forward. As mentioned earlier, a strong pipeline of interest spans financial institutions along with major consumer and commercial brands representing larger and more durable revenue opportunities and with longer sales and integration cycles due to the size and complexity. Shifting to our balance sheet where we remain very well-capitalized. Assets grew by $1.3 billion as a result of $2.1 billion of growth in loans and approximately $800 million decrease in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. On the liability side, member deposits grew by $2.2 billion to $21 billion, while overall deposits increased to $23 billion. We also reduced our brokered deposits by $800 million as we continue to use our consumer deposits to replace higher cost parts of the funding stack and we exited the quarter with $1.1 billion of warehouse debt drawn. Currently, there is a 213 basis point difference between the interest we pay on deposits and the interest we pay on warehouse lines, which translates to about $500 million in annualized interest expense savings given the size of our deposit base. This difference also continues to support our net interest margin, underscoring the benefits of having the option of holding loans on balance sheet when advantageous and collecting net interest income. Overall, we expect to maintain a healthy net interest margin above 5% for the foreseeable future and benefit from the continued mix toward deposit funding along with our ability to sustain healthy deposit versus lending betas. In terms of our regulatory capital ratios, our total capital ratio of 16.8% decreased by approximately 50 basis points from 17.3% last quarter and remains comfortably above the regulatory minimum of 10.5%. Lastly, we grew book value to $5.9 billion and tangible book value by $92 million sequentially to $4.2 billion with tangible book value per share at $3.92. Now on to guidance. Throughout the last 12 months, we have demonstrated the benefit of having a diversified high-growth set of revenue streams, multiple cost-efficient sources of capital, a keen focus on underwriting high quality credit and a high degree of operating leverage as we scale the business. We expect those benefits to persist even in light of the macro backdrop. For Q3, we expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $625 million to $645 million, adjusted EBITDA of $160 million to $165 million, GAAP net income of $40 million to $45 million and EPS of $0.04 per share. For the full year 2024, we now expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $2.425 billion to $2.465 billion, which is $35 million higher than our prior guidance range of $2.39 billion to $2.43 billion. This implies 17% to 19% annual growth versus 15% to 17% previously. This guidance now assumes lending revenue will be at least 95% of 2023 levels, Financial Services will grow more than 80% year-over-year and Tech Platform will grow mid to upper teens percent year-over-year. While this is lower than our original 20% guidance for Tech Platform, we view this as transitory and still feel confident in our multi-year growth guidance for this business. We now expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $605 million to $615 million, above our prior guidance of $590 million to $600 million. This represents a 25% adjusted EBITDA margin. We now expect full-year GAAP net income of $175 million to $185 million, above prior guidance of $165 million to $175 million and GAAP EPS of $0.9 to $0.10 per share, above prior guidance of $0.8 to $0.09 per share. We continue to expect growth in tangible book value of approximately $800 million to $1 billion and continue to expect to end the year with a total capital ratio north of 16%. We continue to expect to add at least 2.3 million new members in 2024, which represents 30% growth. Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Q2 results. Having delivered $597 million of adjusted net revenue and $138 million of adjusted EBITDA, we continue to make great progress against our long-term growth objectives and remain very well-capitalized to continue to pursue our ultimate goal of making SoFi a top financial institution. With that, let's begin the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from John Hecht from Jefferies. John, your line is open. Please go ahead.
John Hecht: Morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions and appreciate all the incremental disclosure in the deck. The question is, I think you said that cumulative losses would have to go above 10%, I think, to 11% for you to kind of breach your 8% assumptions in your underwriting. What kind of scenario would that entail in terms of like payment rates or delinquency rates and just to kind of connect the dots there?
Chris Lapointe: Yeah, sure, John. Thanks for the question. So, like we said, credit is performing in line with expectations and we remain extremely confident in our 7% to 8% life of loan loss assumption. Just to reiterate what I had mentioned in my prepared remarks, when looking at all originations from 2020 through Q1 of 2024, only 44% of those remain. Of the 56% that got paid down, we've experienced only 3% net cumulative losses. So in order to reach 8% cumulative losses on the entire pool, the remaining 44% would need to charge off at 11%. So from where I sit, something would have to materially change in order to hit 8% as prior vintages with similar levels of remaining UPB have never experienced losses even close to 11%. In addition to that, we ended up showing you vintage analyses that highlight how recent vintages since making our credit cuts back in the second half of 2022 are performing materially better than the 2017 cohort which was the last one to come even close to 8%. Furthermore, what gives us even more confidence is that the leading indicator for losses, which is our delinquencies, has started to turn the corner and we're really bending the curve. So in our personal loans business, we ended up surpassing a peak in Q1 on not only dollar principal, but also cumulative fair value adjustments and percentage UPB. So from a dollar principal perspective, we ended up having $96 million of 90-day to 120-day delinquencies in the quarter versus $103 million back in Q1. From a percentage UPB basis, those were at 64 basis points in the quarter versus 72 basis points in Q1. And then from a cumulative fair-value adjustment basis, that was $79 million in Q2 versus $88 million in Q1. And what's even more important than that, these trends are continuing throughout the first several weeks of Q3.
Operator: The next question comes from Terry Ma from Barclays. Terry, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Terry Ma: Hi, thank you. Good morning. So you show some pretty encouraging vintage charge-off metrics on slides 8 and 9. It sounds like from your commentary, everything is kind of in line. But maybe just kind of reconcile your more conservative stance and maybe talk about what you need to see in the environment to maybe just grow a little bit again in the portfolio.
Anthony Noto: Thank you for the question. We're really encouraged by the trends we're seeing in credit. As Chris mentioned, we're really proud of the fact that we're able to achieve record revenue with 22% year-over-year growth with lending barely growing. I would say the areas of incremental opportunity as we go into the back half of the year, home loans, really proud to see the growth rate year-over-year in home loans, student loan refinancing, also a product that shouldn't be doing really well in this interest rate environment also had strong growth. On the personal loan side, we're going to stay relatively conservative compared to our balance sheet ending assets there, primarily because we want to see how the year trends in terms of unemployment. There's a big number coming out on Friday. We're at 4.1% and move to 4.2% could signal a recession. And so while there have been improvements, we're not changing our stance. We're able to achieve pretty strong growth year-over-year without getting too aggressive on the personal loan side. There are factors that could cause us to originate a lot more in personal loans. I will tell you, I see more near-term opportunity in home loans and student loan refinancing. But in personal loan, the thing that would cause us to be more aggressive in terms of the growth rate is if we have greater-than-expected sales. In addition to that, changes in benchmark rates. In addition to that continued improvement in our credit trends, if they start to accelerate better than we've already seen, which is quite positive. But all in all, we have a lot more growth. We could grow much faster if we wanted to, but we want to drive durable diversified growth and that was the reason why we took a stance on limiting our personal loan balances specifically. The other thing that could drive growth which would be further diversification of the balance sheet is home equity loans. We're now doing home equity loans as a principal as opposed to an agent. They're obviously secured lending and attractive rates, more attractive than personal loan rates. So there'll be a greater emphasis on that. That could also drive better performance there. So a lot of opportunities as it relates to the lending business. We're taking a pretty conservative view purposely. I quite frankly, don't feel like we're getting paid for the results we're delivering. So I'm not sure why would be overly aggressive at this point.
Operator: The next question is from Dan Dolev at Mizuho. Dan, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Dan Dolev: Hey guys, great results here. Really appreciate letting us asking a question. So how are you -- Anthony, Chris, like how do you expect to keep growing Financial Services? I mean, obviously, you've grown deposits so much. What -- how do you expect to grow it given that you've grown interest income now? Like if you can talk a little bit about the near-term future? Thank you.
Anthony Noto: Thanks, Dan. Well, first, we did a really incredible job driving the diversification. The only way we're able to achieve record revenue is because our Financial Services segment had a record at $176 million, up 80% year-over-year. It was driven by product growth, as you know, up 47%. It was also driven by deposits up 80%. That drives the net interest income. I think more interestingly is the growth opportunity we have in non-net interest income. We reported $37 million in that line item. It grew very nicely, 58% year-over-year. If you annualize the number, it’s about $150 million. And there's a couple of drivers of that. First, continue to drive increased product growth. We had 47% growth in Financial Services products. That will be one driver of strong growth. The second is increased monetization or revenue per product. We saw strong growth in revenue per product in the mid-20s as well. What drives it going forward from here? Interchange was up 67% year-over-year. AUM was up 58% year-over-year. We'll see benefits in brokerage, not just from AUM growth, but also increased monetization per dollar of AUM, which is about half what we think the benchmark rate is, continue driving home, auto and life insurance, which we call SoFi Protect and then our loan platform business. So it's a combination of those different monetization vehicles that will drive continued revenue per product, which we think has a significant upside after growing 29% already in this quarter. And then our product growth is something that's probably a lot more visible to everyone, which is up 47%. So dual-pronged growth of -- dual-pronged dimensions of growth should continue to drive increased diversification there.
Operator: The next question comes from Kyle Peterson from Needham & Company. Kyle, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kyle Peterson: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to touch on deposits. Obviously, you continue to see nice growth in the core base here with members. But how should we think about the growth outlook for deposits and kind of how that counterbalances with any ongoing runoff of some of the brokered funding?
Anthony Noto: Yeah, I'll let Chris talk about the sort of specific trends in the quarter, but as it relates to the broader macro picture, we're obviously entering an environment where rates are likely to go down in the future. And many people ask us, will you maintain a high rate? And the answer is, we will maintain a high rate relative to our competition. We think we have a competitive advantage given that we have such a big origination platform. That origination platform allows us to fund a higher APY than a lot of other competitors that don't have an origination platform. So the tool businesses work in tandem. As rates go down, the value of our loans generally go up, all else equal. And so we can maintain a superior APY. That doesn't mean we may not change it. It just means it will be superior to drive our differentiated value proposition and leverage our competitive advantage. As it relates to deposits, more specifically, rate is one element of our differentiation. The other elements of differentiation start with no fees. We do not charge. We don't require minimum balances to get our services. You do get a higher APY if you do direct deposit or you do a average monthly deposit of a certain amount. As we mentioned in the call, we'll actually launch SoFi Plus, which will give you that higher rate for a fee per month, which will be quite attractive relative to the amount of interest you could gain when you pay that fee. In addition to that, we have the ability to do person-to-person payments to an email address or a phone number. We recently launched Zelle which is very unique among the fintechs, which is a highly requested product. In addition to that, we provide seamless capabilities into our brokerage business and money movement more broadly. So the APY is one important element of driving deposits, but it's the broader value proposition that we offer that we think will continue to allow us to drive strong deposit growth on the back of strong member growth in Money.
Chris Lapointe: Yeah, and what I would add to that is we've consistently said that we were going to add over $2 billion of member deposits each quarter. We certainly did that in Q1. We did it again in Q2 with $2.2 billion of net new deposits from a member perspective. We did pay down about $800 million of brokered CDs as they had higher costs relative to our member deposits. Right now, we are about just north of 80% deposit funded. Going forward, we believe the optimal mix is consistent with our prior guidance at about 80% to 90%. We still have about $1.1 billion of warehouse debt that's outstanding and nearly $2 billion of brokered deposits. So we're going to continue to optimize funding sources and lower our overall costs.
Operator: The next question comes from Reggie Smith from JPMorgan. Reggie, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Reggie Smith: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I appreciate the disclosure on the loss curves and I hope you guys continue to publish that. Kind of similar thing, I was curious, and I think I asked about this last quarter about the Credit Card program or business, and I look at the fact that you've got 4 million Money users and almost 4 million Relay users and only less than 300,000 credit card accounts. And it would seem that there's an opportunity to kind of really be very targeted to slice and find really prime credits within your customer base. Can you talk a little bit about that? Maybe am I oversimplifying that? It just seems like that business could be a lot bigger than it is, but maybe I just don't understand how that ramps up. So maybe a little color on how that business grows and some of the things that keep it from growing faster than it would appear you have the opportunity to grow.
Anthony Noto: Reggie, thank you for the question on Credit Card. I would start by saying we have a pretty diversified portfolio of products. Our goal is to drive a series of S curves of growth across the products so that we drive strong, durable, diversified compounding growth for years, which means we'll invest in some businesses faster and quicker than others. I often say internally we have some startup businesses. We have some Series A businesses, some late stage growth businesses and some mature growth businesses. Credit Card is one of those early-stage businesses where we want to make sure that we get the marketing, the product market fit correct, the credit correct, and really the overall unit economics of our Credit Card on a per account basis correct. We spent the last 18 months working our butt on that and we feel like we have the right formula. I know we have the right team. We did change the team about a year and a half ago, bringing in someone that's actually built this business from scratch before, in addition to running businesses. So we have a very positive long term outlook for Credit Card and want to contribute to our business. I often say businesses like Credit Card and brokerage by themselves someday could be bigger than SoFi is in total today. There are companies that are very big that are just in the Credit Card business and just in the brokerage business, and to today those are small for us and we're investing aggressively. We pointed out the fact that the brokerage business and the credit card business combined are annualizing a loss of $100 million. So what are the changes we're making in Credit Card specifically. We'll launch two new cards. We'll be testing them slowly. One is an everyday card where people get a much higher percentage reward on categories like food or things that are used every day. The second card is more of a no frills, no surprises card for people that are in our ecosystem that are members, but they have thin credit files, not because they have low credit, they just have very little credit because they may be a new professional in addition to our existing card. Not only we'll launch two more cards, but we'll make those cards work better with our other products. So if you're a SoFi Plus member, your rewards will be boosted because of that relationship between SoFi Plus and Credit Card. So we can start to benefit from not just targeting our members, but giving our members more value for using more than one product and you'll see us continue to do that over time. But in Credit Card today, we're going to continue to move relatively slowly and not step on the gas too hard. Because this is a business you can lose a lot of money and you can lose it every day. It's unlike a loan where you give somebody a fixed amount. In credit card, you have lines that are quite big and they can be utilized in nefarious ways and drive really high losses. So we'll continue to make sure we approach this prudently, but we are stepping on the gas a little bit more than we have in the past.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Adelson from Morgan Stanley. Jeff, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jeff Adelson: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions this morning. I just want to circle back on the lending growth. I know you're still sort of maintaining a more cautious stance on origination there. You did a little bit better than we thought on originations this quarter. And your lending revenue growth looks like it's still up 5% year-over-year. So I guess just, are you seeing better opportunities coming in the door? And does it have anything maybe to do with more certainty around the forward look with rate cuts? I know you're talking about potential increase in unemployment rate from here as well, so just trying to square all that. And then, Chris, also just in terms of the bending of the curb comments on credit, just wondering when you think that might translate into the all-in 5.4% charge off rates starting to come in lower each quarter as well? Thanks, guys.
Anthony Noto: So in the lending business overall, our first objective is to make sure we continue to diversify the lending business relative to the total company. Less capital, less risky businesses get valued much higher, and we don't want to have over dependence on a high capital, high risk business. And this year, the macroeconomic environment accelerated our diversification and it's worked out quite well. We also want to diversify within lending. As I mentioned, home equity loans is diversification into secured lending, which will be our second secured product. In addition to that, student loan refinancing is our oldest and used to be biggest product we think is starting to come into a period where it can do quite well. And that's also diversification relative to unsecured personal loans and then across home loan refinancing is also a vehicle. As we go through the year, I think it's important just to understand we're trying to manage to the overall growth of the company. We have so much resources we want to allocate, and we're allocating it to drive that outcome of diversified, less risky, less capital-intensive businesses. If we wanted to grow personal loans more, we would have to allocate more capital to it. Why? We have to drive marketing that drives the top of the funnel, that then drives conversion. Those loans don't just happen because we decide to actually underwrite more, we actually have to spend money to underwrite more. Right now, we're choosing to spend that money in different areas that don't drive as much revenue. But despite that trade-off, we're still driving 22% year-over-year revenue growth, and a record despite barely growing personal loans. So it's a very conscious effort to diversify in a number of different ways. Diversification means you reallocate resources to other places. If we reallocated to personal loans, we would not achieve our diversification. Now, what happened in the quarter? Our marketing costs were more efficient. The money we were spending was driving more demand than otherwise would have demanded or otherwise would have driven. And we took advantage of the higher unit economics to drive more volume against a set amount of resources in that area. We could be more aggressive if we choose to allocate more resources than lending, that could happen because we have upside in other businesses, that could happen because the marketing efficiency is greater than we anticipated, or the credit is performing better, or we sell more loans. And so it's not because the growth isn't there, it's how we're choosing to allocate the capital in this environment relative to our broader goals. And I'll let Chris talk about the specific question you had on the losses.
Chris Lapointe: Yeah. And in terms of when some of these early DQ trends will start to show up in the NCOs, we're sticking with our overall guidance of being confident in the 7% to 8% life of loan losses. And we aren't guiding to NCO rates specifically. Reason for that is quite simple. The NCO rate is very lumpy. It's a function of a number of different factors, such as originations in the period, sales in the period, and most importantly, the average age or how much UPB remains on the portfolio, which can be driven by a number of things. So overall, we feel really confident in our life of loan loss expectation of 7% to 8%. But we're not guiding to NCOs because they're so lumpy.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Peter Christiansen from Citigroup. Peter, your line is open. Please go ahead
Peter Christiansen: Thank you. Thanks for the question here. Good morning. Nice trends. I was wondering if you could talk about the appetite for future asset sales, either demand for it, but also your risk transfer strategy kind of going forward from here, given that you are seeing improvements -- credit improvements in your portfolio, particularly in the personal loan portfolio. Just how are you thinking about risk transfer from here and if there's further opportunities to derisk the portfolio? Thank you.
Chris Lapointe: Yeah, absolutely. So overall, we're seeing continued strong demand from credit buyers. We've done $3.3 billion in sales over the course of the last three quarters in our personal loan business and $4.7 billion in aggregate. That's predominantly driven by the shape of the interest rate curve with lower expectations in the second half of this year as well as the next several years. So we have very attractive yielding assets with very strong credit profiles and low risk for buyers. Essentially, buyers are looking into locking purchases and programs ahead of any interest rate cuts. In addition to that, we have a really strong balance sheet. We are able to offer flexible deal structures to meet buyers where they need to be. We are one of the few participants that can sell in size. It allows investors to book money to work. It allows buyers to have one buyer versus many, and it allows them to have a long term partner versus doing bespoke one-off transactions that require a ton of work. Buyers want stability of asset generation. So looking forward, we expect to see continued strong demand from credit buyers. In a declining rate environment, we would expect that demand only to increase as those buyers would have lower cost of leverage. And again, we're one of the few folks that have a sizable balance sheet who can do that.
Anthony Noto: We'll take one more question, operator, and then I'll close with comments.
Operator: The final question comes from Tim Switzer from Stifel. Tim, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Tim Switzer: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. How would a return to lower rate environment kind of change the ROE math you guys have talked about on choosing to retain loans versus selling? Do you believe it could strengthen demand at all in the secondary market and kind of change your balance sheet management at all?
Anthony Noto: I would say generally lower rates are going to make the loans more attractive to those without origination platforms that have assets they need to deploy. Our weighted average coupon is quite high and that ROE becomes more attractive as rate environment declines and there's less places for them to find that type of yield. We've seen that in the past be the case. So we would anticipate more demand. We'd have to manage it relative to our production and our own financial goals. But I do believe the demand would increase and the terms would be more favorable and the values also would be attractive. We have to wait and see that happen, but that's what we've seen in the past.
Anthony Noto: Great. In closing, I want to express my gratitude to our team. Q2 was the most rewarding quarter and dare I say, the most fun that I've had in some time at SoFi. What made it special and fun was that we challenged ourselves to be better in areas that are the most difficult in the current environment that aren't supposed to do well in this environment, such as Home Loans and Student Loan refinancing that had volume increases of 71% and 87% year-over-year. The team found a way to be better continuously throughout the entire quarter, not just each month or each week, but literally each day, finishing strong all the way through the tape when quite frankly, the only reason was because we pushed ourselves to keep iterating. It was also fun because we made hard resource allocation decisions in 2023, that meant doing less than we wanted to in areas with great growth potential, such as Invest and Credit Card, where we are now seeing promising results. Our Invest business is accelerating with AUM up 58% on the back of a lot of hard work and only a couple of important areas and a testament that less can be more. In our Credit Card business, the immediate gains from all of our iterations aren't so large today, but with time and scale, they will be massive and well worth the patience. If you can't tell by now, I feel great. To put it bluntly, I do not know of any financial services company or fintech that has transformed their business to be less risky, less capital intensive while still driving strong revenue growth, 40% plus user growth, all while massively increasing profitability and still funding a rapid pace of innovation. When you take a step back, it's inspiring to see. We hit record revenue of nearly $600 million with 22% year-over-year growth despite lending barely growing. We did that because we achieved record revenue in our Financial Services segment at $176 million, up 80% year-over-year on the back of 47% year-over-year growth in products, 80% year-over-year growth in deposits, 58% year-over-year growth in AUM, and 67% year-over-year growth in interchange. In Lending, we grew home loan volume 71% year-over-year, student loan refinancing volume 87% year-over-year and personal loan volume 12% year-over-year while delinquencies declined on an absolute and percentage basis for PL and we provided vintage analysis that clearly shows why we are comfortable with personal loan life of loan loss forecast. And finally, we grew EBITDA 80% year-over-year. I love what we have built. But more than ever, I love the people we are building it with and the gritty culture we have created. Hard is not for everyone, but for me and those who stay at SoFi, it fits just fine. Thank you for your interest in SoFi and talk to you next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you very much for your attendance. You may now disconnect your lines.",split transcript is available for premium subscribers only.,SOFI
2024,Q3,2024-10-29,"Operator: Good morning or good afternoon, all. My name is Adam, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SoFi Technologies Q3 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] With that, you may begin your conference.
Maura Cyr: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to SoFi's third quarter of 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results and recent events are Anthony Noto, CEO; and Chris Lapointe, CFO. You can find the presentation accompanying our earnings release on the Investor Relations section of our website. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations and forecasts and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, our competitive advantage and strategy, macroeconomic conditions and outlook, future products and services, and future business and financial performance. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are described in today's press release and our subsequent filings made with the SEC, including our upcoming Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Anthony.
Anthony Noto: Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. I'm thrilled to share our results for Q3, which was the strongest quarter in our history. I want to thank our members and clients for continuing to put their trust in SoFi, and to thank our team for their absolute grit delivering another great quarter. Our results reflect far more than just 90 days of work. They show how SoFi is consistently achieving durable growth, how our innovation and brand-building are attracting more members and clients to our platform than ever before, and how we are delivering strong and improving returns. I'll touch on these three topics before handing it over to Chris, who will share our financial and operating results. First, on SoFi's performance as a durable growth company, Q3 was another record quarter for SoFi. We built on the strong momentum from the first half of 2024, putting us on pace to significantly exceed our 2024 plan and firmly on track towards the three-year outlook we shared at the end of last year. Here are some highlights. Adjusted net revenue reached a record of $689 million in the quarter, a year-over-year acceleration in growth to 30% versus 22% in Q2. For the first time, financial services makes up more than a third of our total revenue. The segment recorded $238 million of revenue in Q3, up 102% from the prior year. I could not be prouder of how we've scaled this segment over the past five years since launching these products through a tumultuous and unpredictable environment to now be a $1 billion annualized revenue business, growing over 100% with strong and improving profitability. And frankly, it's still day one. Our tech platform grew to nearly $103 million in net revenue, up 14% from the prior year. We continue to see a strong pipeline of potential partners that are striving to modernize their platforms. Combined, our non-lending segments grew 64% year-over-year, and drove the company's overall growth of 30%. And now they make-up a record 49% of total revenue, up from 39% a year-ago, driving an important diversification of our business. We also recorded tremendous growth in key revenue drivers, members, products, as well as revenue per product in the quarter. We added 756,000 new members in Q3. That's up 35% year-over-year to a total of 9.4 million members. We grew products in the quarter by over 1 million to 13.7 million products. That's up 31% year-over-year or 37% when excluding digital asset accounts related to our transfer of crypto services in 2023. The Financial Services segment drove 964,000 of those new products. Importantly, revenue per product was $81, up 52% from $53 a year ago. We believe there remains substantial upside in both product growth and monetization. Our one-stop shop continues to attract great cross-buying behavior by our members. In fact, 32% of new products were opened by existing SoFi members, and 20% of our new members opened a second product in their first 30 days. This is the power of the flywheel we have developed. In our Tech Platform, we reached over 160 million total accounts. That's up 17% year-over-year. Overall, we're making incredible progress in our shift towards more fee-based, capital-light, and lower-risk revenue sources. Combined, fee-based revenue made up $174 million or a quarter of our adjusted net revenue in Q3. This revenue grew by 65% year-over-year. On an annualized basis, that's nearly $700 million in revenue. This progress was driven by a record quarter in our loan platform business, which totaled $56 million in fee-based revenue, and is up more than 5x year-over-year, as well as strong growth in interchange, which is up 2x year-over-year. Chris will share more details on these areas in a few moments. On top of all of this work to diversify our revenue base to capital-light, high return on equity, and fee-based revenue, we also grew our lending segment in Q3. We seized on the improving rate environment in the quarter, our improving credit trends, and strong performance across all lending products to achieve a record $6.3 billion in loan volume, and $392 million in adjusted net revenue, up 14% year-over-year. Looking back at the progress we've made over the past several years, it's fair to say that SoFi is battle tested, given the scale, profitability, and growth we have recorded for the total company in 2024 with our largest and most profitable business lending barely growing. It should now be crystal clear that SoFi can drive sustained growth across the cycle. We've achieved 17 of 19 quarters of record revenue through a recession, a pandemic, a 150 basis point rate drop, damage to our largest and most profitable business, student loan refinance, only to face a 500 basis point increase in rates and the collapse of venerable financial institutions in our neighborhood. The innovations we have driven to scale our non-lending revenue, which are capital-light and high ROE, have enabled us to grow our total revenue by more than 20% year-over-year for 17 consecutive quarters, as well as grow both our members and products by 35% or more year-over-year, excluding digital asset accounts transferred in 2023. Our performance in the hard times is what gives me strong confidence in our future. Today, we face fewer headwinds than any point in our history. We're heading into 2025 with the most favorable conditions of the last seven years with declining rates and a stable economy, with the most diverse business we've ever had, with more members in our ecosystem, and more products that serve their needs than ever before. This brings me to my second topic, the innovation and brand-building that drive our durable growth. The market for consumer financial services is massive and historically poorly served. A Mintel report found that just this year, one in five U.S. adults have been in the market for a new savings account. A similar number are looking for new credit cards. Those markets, not to mention those looking for new investment accounts, new checking accounts, new personal loans, new mortgages, and buy now, pay later, all grew year-over-year. Meeting all of a person's financial needs in one place with world-class products delivered seamlessly and digitally gives us a massive advantage. This is why you will often hear me say, it's a matter of when, not if we become a Top 10 financial institution. To do so, it's absolutely critical that we build the unaided brand awareness to become a trusted household brand name. The awareness we generate for SoFi is highly effective at getting people to try a product. After becoming a member, they cross-buy into another product, then another. They recommend SoFi to others. This flywheel that we've created drives acquisition costs down over time, and reliably generates profits that we can invest in new product innovations to serve even more of our members' needs. Our accomplishments in Q3 demonstrate the power of this virtuous cycle. First, we continue to establish SoFi as a trusted household name. We ended Q3 with our highest average unaided brand awareness of all time, up nearly 40% year-over-year to 7%. Our highly effective marketing engine continues to reach and engage new audiences. For example, Q3 saw the kickoff of the new NFL season at the award-winning SoFi Stadium. We unveiled a new brand campaign with LA Chargers' quarterback, Justin Herbert, inspiring people to reach their most important financial ambitions. We also launched new partnerships with Los Angeles Sparks' forward, Cameron Brink, and tennis champion, Venus Williams. And coming in January, the TGL presented by SoFi, a new tech-infused arena golf league with an exciting match-play format across teams of top PGA TOUR golfers like Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, Wyndham Clark, Xander Schauffele, and Justin Thomas, just to name a few. Second, we continue to innovate so people find unique value when they use our products. Starting with our Financial Services segment, in SoFi Invest, we've seen strong engagement driven by new alternative assets, mutual funds, and money market funds we've rolled out over the past year. Overall, we're providing Main Street investors access to unique investment products historically reserved for the ultra-wealthy like interval funds, private credit, private real estate, and private venture. We also launched our new directed share program, which offers a modern and streamlined approach to equity programs for companies looking to raise capital through IPOs. And we are expanding our award-winning robo offering later this year. Importantly, we are building the Invest business cost-effectively by appealing to existing members. 70% of sign-ups are existing SoFi members. In SoFi Money, we reached record highs in accounts, total deposits, and direct deposit members. We grew member deposits by nearly $2.4 billion and annualized debit spending reached $10.3 billion in Q3. We will soon improve our self-serve wire transfers, which similar to introducing Zelle, will further expand members money movement options. In our member team, we're beta testing a new cash coach product that will analyze members' cash across all of their financial products at SoFi and beyond, and offer various ways to optimize their cash, whether it's paying down expensive debt, setting up an emergency savings fund, getting more yield on their savings, or making investments in a diversified portfolio that is appropriate for their goals. We're also on track to launch improvements to SoFi Plus, our premium membership tier, and our beta testing, a new fee-based subscription option in the coming months. Over time, SoFi Plus will increasingly show the magic of our strategy, deliver incremental and unmatched value across our portfolio of products. In Credit Card, we officially launched the Everyday Cash Rewards and the Essential credit cards, enabling SoFi to serve more people's spending and borrowing needs, whether it's helping them earn rewards or building their credit. In our loan platform business, what started as a decline monetization funnel, has now evolved into an integrated loan platform experience, which now offers just-in-time lending. In Q3, the loan platform business grew 5x year-over-year, mainly driven by record personal loan volume. We expect this business to continue to grow as we shift towards even more fee-based, capital-light, and lower-risk sources of revenue. We also signed our first two direct insurance carriers for SoFi Protect, complementing our comprehensive financial services offering we've built over the last five years. Turning to our Lending segment. In personal loans, our innovation has helped generate a record $4.9 billion in volume, up 26% year-over-year, including $1 billion originated on behalf of third parties for our loan platform business. In home loans, we grew total home loan volume 38% year-over-year to $490 million. Home equity loan volume was up 44% from the prior quarter as rates began to decline. Home purchase and refinancing volumes grew 23% from the prior year period. In fact, home refinancing volume was the highest we've seen since the second quarter of 2022. And finally, in our Tech Platform, we signed several new partnerships, including processing deals with two charter banks of Mexico and a deployment of Galileo's Cyberbank Core for SoFi's new commercial payment services sponsor bank program. We launched additional fraud prevention solutions, the Galilo Instant Verification Engine, which we call GIVE, as well as Transaction Risk GScore, both of which help clients enhance their security and operational efficiency. Our new Secured Credit with Dynamic Funding offering promotes greater financial inclusion and enables clients to help their customers build stronger credit. And lastly, we launched programs with clients signed in prior quarters spanning cross-border payments, global payouts, financial literacy and scalable payment solutions. On top of this relentless focus on innovation and brand-building, we built our business to deliver strong and reliable returns well into the future. We achieved record profitability in Q3. GAAP net income reached nearly $61 million, a $327 million improvement year-over-year or $80 million when excluding the goodwill impairment expense we incurred in the prior year. EBITDA grew 90% from the prior year to a record of $186 million. All three of our operating segments achieved record contribution profit in the quarter. We continue to improve credit performance in Q3 and are firmly within the life of loan guidance we've previously provided. As we've shared in our last call, delinquencies peaked in March of 2024. Since then, we've continued to see improvements quarter-over-quarter. Cumulative fair value adjustments along with delinquencies on an absolute and percentage basis all performed better in Q3. With all the innovations we've made across marketing, originations and servicing, buyers continue to see compelling opportunities in SoFi's loan portfolio. Loan sales reached almost $1.3 billion in total this quarter and nearly $5 billion in the last 12 months. And finally, with our strong balance sheet, we are well-capitalized heading into an improving rate environment. Our total capital ratio is 16.3%, well-above regulatory minimums. In Q3, tangible book value increased $236 million to a total of $4.4 billion. We look forward to building on this momentum and delivering continued returns heading into the new year. In closing, I couldn't be more proud of what we've accomplished, not just for Q3, but for delivering a steady and consistent record of durable growth, incredible brand building and product innovation that help our members and clients, and strong improving returns for our shareholders. Their future is bright and I am fired up for what's in store. With that, I'll hand it over to Chris.
Chris Lapointe: Thanks, Anthony. I'm going to walk through key financial highlights and our financial outlook. Unless otherwise stated, I'll be referring to adjusted results for the third quarter of 2024 versus the third quarter of 2023. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-Q filing, which will be made available next month. The record results we achieved across all three segments this quarter are a testament of our continued execution, our durable growth in members, products and clients, and our diversification toward capital-light, fee-based revenue with increased returns. For the quarter, we delivered record adjusted net revenue of $689 million, with growth accelerating to 30% year-over-year, up from 22% last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $186 million at a 27% margin. This represents nearly 9 points of year-over-year margin improvement, demonstrating significant operating leverage across all of our functions with expense margins decreasing year-over-year. Importantly, sales and marketing continues to decline as a percentage of adjusted net revenue, decreasing by 4 points year-over-year. We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability with GAAP net income reaching nearly $61 million, a $327 million improvement year-over-year, or $80 million when excluding the goodwill impairment expense we incurred in the prior year period. We generated GAAP EPS at $0.05 per share in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, we delivered $214 million of GAAP net income. And when looking at the sum of our reported EPS over the past four quarters, we generated about $0.11 per share. Now, on to the segment-level performance, where we saw record revenue and contribution profit across all three operating segments. Starting with Financial Services, we achieved $238 million in net revenue, up more than 2x year-over-year. We reached nearly 11.8 million products in the quarter, up 33% year-over-year or 40% when excluding crypto accounts. We continue to improve monetization across all products with annualized revenue per product of $81, up 52% year-over-year versus $53 in the prior year quarter. This growth was driven by higher deposits and member spending in SoFi Money and significant expansion of our Loan Platform Business, which I'll describe in a moment. Both of these businesses achieved all-time records for revenue in Q3. We also benefited from new monetizable features in SoFi Invest and a saw robust growth in credit card spend. We see significant opportunity for growth in these businesses as well as SMB and Protect, which are all under-monetized today. Net interest income of $154 million increased 66% year-over-year, which was primarily driven by growth in consumer deposits. Non-interest income grew 235% to $84 million in the quarter, which represents nearly $340 million in annualized revenue. A key driver of non-interest income growth this quarter was our loan platform business, where we refer pre-qualified borrowers to origination partners and originate loans on behalf of third-parties. Here's how our loan platform business works. With our best-in-class product, highly effective marketing engine, and network of respected buyers like Fortress, with whom we announced a $2 billion Loan Platform Business agreement earlier this month, we can efficiently match the demand of members shopping for loans with the demand for high-quality loans in the capital markets. When a member takes out a loan, they gain all of the benefits of becoming a SoFi member along with easy access to other products in our one-stop shop, even though we originated the loan on someone else's behalf. This enables SoFi to serve more potential members, while also further diversifying toward less capital-intensive and more fee-based sources of revenue. In Q3, we generated $56 million in loan platform fees, driven by $1 billion of personal loans originated on behalf of third parties as well as referrals. We also generated $5.5 million in servicing cash flows, which is recorded in our lending segment. Our Loan Platform Business in total added $61 million to our adjusted net revenue. In addition to our Loan Platform revenue, we continue to see healthy growth in interchange, up 211% year-over-year as a result of $12 billion in total annualized spend in the quarter across Money and Credit Card. Overall, contribution profit for our Financial Services segment in the quarter was a record at nearly $100 million at a 42% margin, even as we continue to invest in innovation, acquisition costs that require a payback period, and new opportunities to rapidly grow this operating segment with attractive returns. Shifting to our Tech Platform segment, where we delivered record net revenue of nearly $103 million in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Revenue growth was driven by strong contribution from new clients, as well as growth in Latin America, consumer brands in the U.S., and clients with innovative use cases like earned wage access and money movement. Galileo accounts grew 17% year-over-year to $160 million. The segment delivered a record contribution profit of $33 million, representing a 32% margin. We've discussed before how the pipeline spans banks, brands, and fintechs across consumer and B2B, which offer larger and more durable revenue. The pipeline is in a stronger spot than it's ever been, and the investments made in this segment have greatly expanded the market opportunity. Recent wins and pipeline strength are early, but telling signs that the strategy is working. Moving on to Lending. We achieved record adjusted net revenue of $392 million, with a record of $239 million of contribution profit at a 61% adjusted margin. These results were driven by 19% year-over-year growth in net interest income, while adjusted non-interest income decreased by 2% year-over-year. Growth in net interest income was driven by a 35% year-over-year increase in average interest-earning assets, slightly offset by a 44 basis point year-over-year decrease in average yields. This resulted in an average net interest margin of 5.6% for the quarter. In terms of non-interest income, Q3 originations grew 23% year-over-year to over $6.3 billion, and were driven by a record quarter in personal loan originations, which grew 26% year-over-year and 17% sequentially to $4.9 billion, with $1 billion originated on behalf of third parties for our loan platform business. Our student loans business saw origination volume grow 3% year-over-year and 28% sequentially to $944 million, our best quarter since Q1 2022. Home loans volume grew by 38% year-over-year and 17% sequentially to $490 million, our best quarter since 2021. In the third quarter, we sold portions of our personal loan, home loan, and senior secured loan portfolios totaling $1.3 billion. In terms of personal loan sales, we closed approximately $375 million of loans in whole loan form at an execution of 105.9%. These had similar structures to other recent personal loan sales with cash proceeds at or near par, and the majority of the premium consisting of contractual servicing fees that are capitalized. These sales included a small loss share provision that is above our base assumption of losses and immaterial relative to the exposure we would otherwise have if we held the loans. Our $504 million of home loan sales were sold at a blended execution of 102.6%. Additionally, we sold $81 million of late-stage delinquent personal loans in the quarter. As we've noted in the past, we typically have not sold delinquent loans until such a time that they are charged off. However, we have been able to generate positive incremental value over time in these sales relative to selling after they charge off both from our improved recovery capabilities and by maintaining servicing. Finally, we sold $312 million of senior secured loans at a par execution. In addition, one of our large senior secured loans with $594 million of principal outstanding was prepaid and refinanced by the borrower and is no longer on the balance sheet. Net-net, inclusive of new issuance in period, our secured loan balance decreased by more than $750 million sequentially. These transactions demonstrate clear market support for the marks on these loans with $312 million of our senior secured loans sold at our marked value, and another $594 million of senior secured loans prepaid so the borrower could refinance with another bank at more attractive rates. Turning to the profile of our borrower and the overall credit performance. Our personal loan borrowers' weighted average income is $164,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 746. Our student loan borrowers' weighted average income is $135,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 765. After seeing credit trends peak in Q1, we have seen continued improvement in personal loans. Our on-balance sheet 90-day personal loan delinquency rate was 57 basis points in the quarter, a decrease from 64 basis points in Q2, which is further evidence of surpassing a peak in Q1. Our personal loan annualized charge-off rate decreased to 3.52% from 3.84% in Q2, including the impact of asset sales, new originations, and the delinquency sale in the quarter. Had we not sold these late-stage delinquencies, we estimate that including recoveries between 90 days and 120 days delinquent, we would have had an all-in annualized net charge-off rate for personal loans of approximately 5.0% versus 5.4% last quarter. For our student loans, our on-balance sheet 90-day delinquency rate remained flat quarter-over-quarter at 12 basis points, while our annualized charge-off rate was 69 basis points. The data continues to support our 7% to 8% maximum life of loan loss assumptions for personal loans, in line with our underwriting tolerance. Similar to last quarter, we provided a loan vintage analysis on Page 10 of our investor presentation. Since this only provides a partial window into our loan portfolio, we're unlikely to provide the same analysis longer term. However, it's a helpful illustration of how recent vintages are collectively performing against our 2017 vintage as this is the last time that we approached 8% life of loan losses at 7.85%. You can see significant improvement in cumulative net losses at a given percentage of remaining unpaid principal for more recent 2022 and 2023 vintages. Specifically looking at the Q4 2022 to Q4 2023 vintages, soon after we made material cuts to credit, net cumulative losses of 3.3% are well below the 4.8% observed in the 2017 vintage at the same point of 49% remaining principal balance. The gap between the newer cohort curve and the 2017 cohort curve widened slightly quarter-over-quarter. Furthermore, looking at Page 11 in the investor presentation, you will notice that only 43% of unpaid principal balance remains from our Q1 2020 through Q2 2024 originations. Among the 57% of principal that has already been paid down, we've seen 6% in net cumulative losses. For life of loan losses on this entire cohort of loans to reach 8% net cumulative losses, the remaining unpaid principal would need to charge off at a rate of more than 10%. Past vintages have performed meaningfully better after this point in the seasoning curve, further improving our confidence in achieving loss rates below 8%. Now turning to our fair value marks and key assumptions. Our personal loans are marked at a 105.7%, 142 basis points higher quarter-over-quarter. This was driven by a 97 basis point decrease in the discount rate to 4.78%, which was directly driven by the drop in benchmark rates by 113 basis points and offset by 16 basis points of spread widening. The constant default rate, or CDR, also decreased by 28 basis points, which is consistent with the observed credit trends I just highlighted. For our student loan portfolio, the fair value mark increased by 183 basis points to 105.4%. This was driven by a 45 basis point decrease in the discount rate to 3.99% due to an 87 basis point decrease in rates, but offset by 42 basis points of spread widening. The weighted average coupon in the portfolio also increased by 17 basis points. The fair value gains in the quarter were significantly more than offset by our hedge losses and the negative impact from spreads widening. Net-net, we did not see a positive impact on the reported revenue from the change in marks, net of hedge losses and new originations. Switching to our balance sheet, where we remain very well-capitalized. Assets grew by $1.7 billion as a result of nearly $1.4 billion growth in loans and approximately $226 million of an increase in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. On the liability side, member deposits grew by nearly $2.4 billion to nearly $23 billion, while overall deposits increased to $24 billion. We reduced our brokered deposits by $445 million as we continue to use our consumer deposits to replace higher-cost parts of the funding stack. Currently, there is a 220 basis points difference between interest we pay on deposits and the interest we pay on warehouse lines, which translates to more than $500 million in annualized interest expense savings, given the size of our deposit base. We exited the quarter with just $1.3 billion of warehouse debt drawn. This difference continues to support our net interest margin of 5.6%, underscoring the benefits of having the option of holding loans on balance sheet when advantageous in collecting net interest income. We continue to expect to maintain a healthy net interest margin above 5% for the foreseeable future and benefit from the continued mix shift towards deposit funding along with our ability to sustain healthy deposit versus lending betas. In terms of our regulatory capital ratios, our total capital ratio of 16.3% remains comfortably above the regulatory minimum of 10.5%. Lastly, we grew book value to $6.1 billion and tangible book value by $236 million sequentially to $4.4 billion with tangible book value per share at $4. Now on to guidance. For the full year 2024, we now expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $2.535 billion to $2.550 billion, which is $85 million higher than our prior guidance range of $2.425 billion to $2.465 billion. This implies 22% to 23% annual growth versus 17% to 19% previously. This guidance assumes Lending revenue will be at least 100% of 2023 levels, Financial Services will grow more than 80% year-over-year, and Tech Platform will grow low- to upper-teens percent year-over-year. We now expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $640 million to $645 million, above our prior guidance of $605 million to $615 million. This represents a 25% adjusted EBITDA margin. We now expect full-year GAAP net income of $204 million to $206 million above prior guidance of $175 million to $185 million, and GAAP EPS of $0.11 to $0.12 per share above prior guidance of $0.09 to $0.10 per share. We now expect growth in tangible book value of approximately $1 billion to $1.05 billion and continue to expect to end the year with a total capital ratio at or above 16%. In terms of member growth, we expect to add at least 2.3 million new members in 2024, which represents 30% growth. Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Q3 results. We continue to demonstrate our position as a durable growth story, which is reflected in this quarter's strong results. Despite operating in unpredictable macro conditions, we've maintained a clear focus on executing our strategy, driving returns, and helping our members get their money right. We could not be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us as we continue our journey towards becoming a top financial institution. With that, let's begin the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Dan, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Dan Dolev: Hi guys. Great results as always. Can you give us some more color on the loan platform deals, like how do you make money here and how does this differ from the prior quarters? Thanks again great results.
Anthony Noto: Sure. Thanks, Dan. And so overall, this is a great fee-based and capital-light revenue source for us. We're not taking balance sheet risk. We're generating meaningful cash fees upfront at time of transfer or referral and we're able to serve the needs of more members at a more rapid pace than we've been able to do so before. So, there are several ways that we make revenue within the business, which has certainly evolved since we started focusing on decline monetization in 2019. First is we send qualified borrowers to platform partners via our Lantern marketplace and we receive a referral fee if the borrower takes out a loan. The second way we make money is we can embed the specific credit box of our platform partners into our underwriting engine and originate on behalf of those partners with the transfer of those loans to the partner occurring shortly after origination. For that, we receive an upfront cash fee and we also retain servicing. The third way and what's new this quarter is that we're able to originate on behalf of other third-party investors based on a specific asset characteristic and return profile of that investor with loans transferred shortly after origination. This is within days or a week. We receive an upfront cash fee -- platform fee for that business and we also retain servicing. And then the fourth way that we can make money and we've been doing this for a few quarters now is we can service assets that we do not originate, but are held on the balance sheets of other third-parties. For that, we receive regular servicing fees that are not capitalized. What I would say is important is in all of these cases, these are assets that we wouldn't have otherwise underwritten unless contracted due to a number of reasons, including, first, the credit profile and other characteristics of the assets, which may not be directly consistent with our current portfolio. Second, our own risk appetite may not align with those originations. And then finally, our capital allocation strategy at any given point in time may not align. The last thing I would say here is that there are no financing commitments or lost share agreements associated with any of these deals or partnerships. And the only other thing I would add, Dan, and this may not be known by a lot of people, but we declined between 70% and 80% of the personal loan applicants to SoFi. And so there's a lot of potential -- latent potential there to service them better. And so that's a big number that exists before we even try to do anything else in this business in terms of generating incremental demand or other initiatives to make people aware of the products that we can offer.
Operator: The next question comes from Terry Ma from Barclays. Terry, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Terry Ma: Hi, thank you. Good morning. So your originations came in ahead of our expectations and it's increased each quarter of this year. Credit seems to be improving sequentially and the macro probably a little bit less clear than earlier this year. So I guess going-forward, how do you think about originations and lending growth for your own balance sheet versus maybe originating for some of your big partnerships.
Anthony Noto: Yes. What I would say is our overall outlook for originations or at least growth on the balance sheet has not changed. We do expect to see modest growth in dollar terms on the balance sheet year-over-year and that will continue into Q4. We are happy with the size of the balance sheet that we have today and the amount of net interest income that we're generating. We are seeing excess demand both on the borrower side as well as the loan investor side for our unsecured personal loans, and we've been able to successfully navigate and fulfill that demand through the expansion of our loan platform business. So, we would expect not to grow the PL balance sheet meaningfully from where we are today. Where we will migrate into is in a lower rate environment, you would see an uptick in-demand for our student loan refinancing business where we had a really strong quarter this quarter as well as our home loans business where we had our best quarter since 2021.
Operator: The next question comes from John Hecht from Jefferies. John, your line is open. Please go ahead.
John Hecht: Good morning, guys. Congratulations and thanks for taking my question. I appreciate all the information on the credit slide about the 17 vintage versus the more recent ones. It looks like the current vintages are performing better than the 2017 vintage. I'm wondering how do you guys think about that? The contribution of that performance trend to like return on capital? And how do prepayments, or your just payment assumptions impact this outcome as well?
Chris Lapointe: Yes, thanks John. So, we often talk about underwriting to an 8% life alone loss target, which obviously reflects the strength of our underwriting and the high quality of our borrower base. However, life alone losses represents just one of several variables, which in combination actually drive our pricing, and underwriting decisions designed to maximize return on equity, while adhering to our credit risk tolerance. In terms of how we think about the returns on recent, versus some of our past vintages, all in returns on our more recent vintages are projected, to produce meaningfully higher returns. I'm talking greater than 2x versus 2017, with newer vintages expected to produce ROEs above 30%. And I'm defining ROE here, as the weighted average coupon minus annual losses, funding costs and other operational costs plus origination fees. And then multiplied by the weighted average life and levered. What's really driving those increases in returns, is a function of a number of things. First, is lower expected life alone loss rates as we show in our Investor Presentation on Page 10. Second is the higher pricing beta throughout rate increase cycles. We've demonstrated time-and-time again that we've been able to maintain really good betas. We were successful in increasing the portfolio weighted average coupon, across both products in a rising rate environment over the course of the last few years. And we've also been able to maintain pricing in down rate environments, due to the quality of our product. The third way is we've had funding cost efficiencies, given our higher reliance on member deposits and success in growing direct deposits, and replacing higher cost warehouse funding. And then fourth, we've introduced origination fees over the course of the last year plus, and we're now generating close to $400 million in origination fees annually. So the combination of these drivers, is more than offsetting the increase in prepayment speeds, and the reduction in weighted average lives that we're observing in some of these newer cohorts. Going forward, what I would say, is we're going to be talking about return metrics more often, because these life alone losses don't provide the full view.
Anthony Noto: Another thing I would just emphasize, John, and everyone - and the shareholders more broadly, is that we've been able to achieve these types of high ROE returns in more recent vintages despite the fact that rates have been, increased significantly in a very short period of time and the economy has been somewhat uncertain, during that time period. As we look into 2025, and declining rate environment in a stable economy, we think we can only improve on these returns. And it's one of the reasons why we're leveraging all the different businesses. We are across the opportunity set that we have from a return standpoint, relative to what we believe is a prudent level of balance sheet risk, in a particular asset class such as personal loans. So we think there's a lot of upside and it only gets better from here.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Adelson from Morgan Stanley. Jeff, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jeff Adelson: Hi, good morning. Could you just talk a little bit more about the expectations for the loan platform business, how you expect that can grow from here? I know you said expect that to continue growing, but how meaningful can this become? It seems like if we look at the numbers today, it's already at a $4 billion run rate. You've got the Fortress relationship, which, correct me if I'm wrong, its additive to that. So that's already $6 billion. And should we be thinking about the economics as close to a 5.5% take rate, based on the revenues you reported this quarter? And then, I'm just curious, are you going to maybe deemphasize the loan sales a little bit more from here? I mean, it came in a little bit lower at the $375 million versus the billing for the last three quarters, as you maybe prioritize the loan platform business from here? Thanks.
Chris Lapointe: Yes. So I'll start and Anthony can chime in wherever. But in terms of the overall growth expectations, what I would say is as part of that billion dollars of originations that we did, Jeff, in the period. A portion of that did come from the Fortress transaction that, we announced earlier in the quarter. So it's not additive to your $4 billion run rate. It's inclusive of that. But we do expect to see continued strong growth in the segment. We have that $2 billion agreement with Fortress, as well as commitments for Q4 and 2025, with several other partners. What I would say, is we're one of the very few partners who can deliver assets at scale, with the characteristics and return profile that investors are seeking. In terms of deemphasizing other sales, and ABS transactions in favor of this, what I would say is that, demand is as strong as it's ever been before. Like I had mentioned a few questions ago, we're happy with the size of the balance sheet and the modest growth that we're expecting, expecting over the course of the next three months. But what I would say is that, we are seeing excess demand both from borrowers and investors, and a way to fulfill that demand is through the LPB business. In terms of the take rate, what I would say is. We're looking at apples-and-oranges when you're trying to compare this take rate, to what you see in the general originate to sell business. These are loans that are originated on behalf of others, and they would not have been originated unless contracted to given the credit - and overall asset characteristics of the loans, as well as our own risk appetite and capital allocation strategy. What we're receiving is a platform fee for our underwriting capabilities, our marketing capabilities, and our overall operational capabilities. And that platform fee will vary depending on the partner.
Anthony Noto: And I think, a couple points just to emphasize. One is, the partners in the loan platform business, many of which are new incremental partners on loans as opposed to the wholesale loan buyers, or ABS buyers that we typically had. They're not all incremental, but a large percentage of them are including in the most recent quarter. In addition to that, Chris has mentioned a couple times. These are loans that wouldn't have otherwise originated, and we only originate when we actually have a contract. So it's not a zero sum game, it's incremental. And the outlook for is pretty significant as we go into 2025, in excess of what you articulated.
Chris Lapointe: The only other thing I would say in terms of, you had mentioned $375 million of sales done in period. We did over $1 billion across all three products in the quarter and $6 billion over the course of the last 12 months in overall loan sales, quarter-to-date in Q4, we've already done close to $1 billion in sales, across our products as well. So the demand is certainly there. We will continue to fulfill on both ends. But as Anthony mentioned, being able to originate on behalf of others is purely incremental to us.
Operator: The next question comes from Kyle Peterson from Needham and Co. Kyle, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kyle Peterson: Great. Thanks guys and good morning. Nice results. Wanted to ask a question on deposits. Some of the trends you guys are seeing there, you guys had really nice growth there despite I believe you took down the rate paid on member deposits, a bit as rates have gone down. So just any color on whether you've seen any changes in average balances, or customer behavior, or if things have been pretty receptive to some of the changes you guys have made on, deposit rates kind of early on in the rate cut cycle?
Anthony Noto: Yes, we're really proud of the way the SoFi Money product continues to resonate in the marketplace, despite rates coming down more broadly. We've maintained our market share position, we've maintained our ranking in an APY standpoint, of course we do not charge fees. We obviously give a number of other benefits including the high interest rate, not to mention all the functionality you need in one place. So we've seen continued strong trends in deposits, over $2 billion of member deposit growth in the quarter. In addition to that, the spending levels that we're seeing are on parents, to better to where they have been historically. And so, we're continually getting positive indicators, across the entire business as it relates to SoFi Money. The other thing I would just mention, this is one of the key points of where the flywheel starts. Our direct deposit customers are customers that are more engaged. They have meaningfully higher number of products per customer, compared to the overall average that we report. And when you look at it on a vintage basis, it's even better than the overall average number of products per direct deposit members. So it's been over a year in, which we've operated this business as a bank. And being able to control our own destiny, and having a competitive advantage in being both an origination platform on loans, as well as a national bank that can set its own interest rate, and its own value proposition. It's a competitive advantage and one that's continued in the quarter. And we're excited about next year.
Operator: The next question comes from Mihir Bhatia from Bank of America. Mihir, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Mihir Bhatia: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to stay with the Financial Services segment again, and I wanted to just talk about a couple of things there. One is just about monetization in the segment. I think it's up to $81 annually now. Any targets you can share on what you think that can look like maybe this time next year, or just you know, to achieve your three year targets that you laid out. Like how much more monetization can that be? And then just related to that, just I guess what is the next growth, you mentioned SMB PROTECT in your remarks. You also launched the credit card more broadly. So maybe talk to us about where that next growth vector is materializing from. I guess really what I'm asking is what's the next lending platform business in that sector, right. Like I think it was a pretty big surprise for a lot of people how much that business grew this quarter. So give us a…?
Anthony Noto: You've hit the nail in the head. Yes, thank you. You've hit the nail on the head. It's an exciting part of our business. The fact that we're approaching $1 billion annualized business, very profitable while we're still in investment mode. It's pretty amazing to have a business of that size, $23 million of revenue, growing over 100% and profitable despite how fast we are growing the number of members, and products and revenue per product. And I think the best way to sort of conceptualize where this business could go, is to think about those three variables, member growth, product growth and revenue per product. The revenue per product that we generate today was up meaningfully in the quarter, as you mentioned, but it's nowhere near where it can be long-term. As it relates to our invest business, we're monetizing at about half the rate that we think we can monetize it over time. In 2025, we'll take a number of steps where we start to monetize that better, of course, by adding incremental value to the invest experience. Our invest product is unique in that we're trying to be a one-stop shop just within Invest. We pioneered fractional shares. We obviously don't pay - charge on trades. In addition to that, we created our own ETFs that would better meet the needs of our new and beginning investors. That are lower price point, but diversified, allowing our members to do dollar cost averaging in a diversified way. We have award-winning robo accounts, and we continue to evolve those and you'll see us do more in 2025, behind that to not just grow assets, but also to increase monetization. We do IPOs, which is a direct monetization vehicle. But again, a unique product remain Street investors get access to IPOs and IPO prices. And then our alternate asset classes and mutual funds that we launched have really been a tailwind for us, in terms of driving more engagement. That's something today that we don't monetize that we will monetize in the future. So just in the Invest business, we have over 100% opportunity, to increase the monetization per member not to mention the fact, how fast the products and invest are growing. And remember, when you do the calculation on Invest product growth, you have to normalize it for the lost crypto members, or products that we had a year ago that were transferred. SoFi Money business, we continue to see nice trends in deposits and spending, and the monetization there will continue to improve with more deposits, and more spending as opposed to a change in rate per se. In addition to that, our credit card business is another source of monetization opportunity. As balances continue to increase, we'll have more monetization there in addition to the more members that we add the more monetization that we drive, because that's a higher interchange revenue than our debit interchange. And so, as you see a mix shift, you'll see an improvement in monetization there, not to mention just the absolute increase in monetization. And then as it relates to small medium business, we're just scratching the surface. The biggest initiative we had so far in 2024, was to take the application process and embed it into the SoFi app. So when all the demand that we get for small and medium business comes to SoFi, they can within the native app, apply for a loan and then be referred to a partner as it relates to lending. We also do that as it relates to banking, you'll continue to see us do that in a much bigger and broader way. There is monetization there today, but we could do more products and more services to drive greater monetization not to mention doing it ourselves at some point, which we would like to do over time. It is an early-stage business, and we want to crawl before we walk and then ultimately run. So you'll see that in the SMB business. On the insurance side, the deals that we're doing in the marketplace, increase our monetization there, but also increases penetration. So over 100% revenue growth in the quarter, driven by the really strong product growth and revenue per product. And he has focused on those two measurements, you'll be able to forecast a pretty sizable business with great profitability. The last point I make on profitability, is we're still losing a large amount of money in the credit card business and Invest business, because the payback there is, is longer. And it's not a business that we get return on in one year. It takes anywhere from one and a half to two to three years, depending on the J curve of the credit business. So what's masking the profitability is that investment there. If we actually subtracted added back the losses that we're losing there, the number would be even bigger on the profitability side. And that's before we've improved any of the monetization.
Maura Cyr: I found this on the web.
Operator: The next question is from Peter Christiansen from Citigroup. Peter, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Peter Christiansen: Nice trends here. I was just curious, bigger picture, can we talk about what you're seeing in the alt credit side, credit is certainly becoming a theme, some of your marketplace lending peers have also benefited here. In your discussions pipeline, just curious if you think this is emerging as a larger theme over the next 12, 18 months? And then finally, as it relates to tech platform performance pipeline, can you talk to the degree of decision delay you're seeing currently, versus last quarter? Thank you.
Anthony Noto: Yes. In terms of demand for our loans from buyers or investors, similar to other people, the demand has increased quite meaningfully. We are better at being able to meet some of that demand, by continue to evolve our business from origination platform for our own loans, and now the evolution of the loan platform business. So similar to others, we're seeing an increase of it from existing buyers. But also a number of new partners that we've not been able to meet their needs with before, but we now can. So really excited about declining rate environment, putting a tailwind behind the loans, not to mention our new initiatives there. As it relates to the tech platform, no decisions have been made by any of the big deals that we've been in process with over the last 12 to 18 months. I do think we're coming to the end of some of those decisions being made. And I would just say that we haven't had anything announced. But I would just tell you I'm confident that we will have some wins there, but none of the decisions have been made on any of the large deals. And I would just give you more color on the types of deals. There are definitely big financial institutions that have to make some decisions on their technology. They continue to really struggle with how they budget for that transition. But without a doubt, there's a technical reason why they have to switch. There's a risk reason why they have to switch, and there's a regulatory reason. And so, it's going to be an inevitable change, and a tailwind to the demand for technology, like we have in our tech platform business, and specifically in core and processing. And it's just a question of when, and I think we'll win our fair share of deals there, but none have been decided yet. The second area that we haven't talked as much about in the past, is the opportunity to help large branded companies that have big installed bases, they're in the financial services business already today through a credit card, and a white label credit card. There's absolutely a significant amount of demand from those types of partners for us to do something very similar on the debit side of the business. And we continue to receive RFPs, for that type of product. And then, of course, outside of the direct-to-consumer businesses, there is demand from government agencies, there's demand for B2B companies that continue to surface and some of, which we've signed and executed against, some of which will be decided over the coming months.
Operator: The next question comes from Jill Shea from UBS. Jill, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jill Shea: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You launched the everyday Cash Rewards and the essential credit cards while early days. Can you just talk about the early indications there, and your view of future growth on the card products?
Anthony Noto: Yes. We really like the card business long term. It obviously is an expensive endeavor near term. There's a J curve of about three years in that business. We have a world-class team that's done this before. That wasn't the case when we first launched. The two cards that you mentioned, are a direct result of all the work the team - our second team that came in and run this business has done. We did a test with the business. We saw the type of performance that we were hoping to see. Our marketing capabilities there have also helped us deliver the type of performance, we wanted to see in those cards. And that's why we went general availability for those cards, as opposed to just testing. I will say we will take a very methodical approach to the credit card business. While it is a great ROE business. It also does have the ability to lose a lot of money and lose money every day. And so, we'll continue to make sure that, that card is something that we market to individuals that we think have a high probability, of utilizing it in the right way, and we can get a great return on it. So, we'll start with our members, and we'll continue to use the data that we have on them to make decisions. We can use that data to model opportunities off of our platform, which we're starting to do as well. Inside of the Financial Services business, think about as a couple of different types of segments. We have businesses that are still growing very fast that, are profitable like SoFi Money, we have businesses that are growing very fast and losing money like invest in credit card. And then we have businesses that are early stage. And we're planting seeds that will continue to be harvested over time, and grown over time. And this is a business that's in the middle, one that we feel we're confident in terms of our go-to-market. And one that will grow, but we'll do it methodically over time, to make sure that we do not push too hard on the investment, we have to make and offset the profitability overall business, but it will be a good contributor.
Operator: At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Anthony Noto for closing remarks.
Anthony Noto: Thank you, operator, and thanks for everyone that's dialed into the call. I have some closing remarks, I want to share. As I mentioned at the end of Q2, I cannot feel better about what we've achieved and where we're headed right here, and right now. The list of achievements is far, too, great to capture every quarter, so let me be succinct and clear. Despite the tumultuous environment over the past seven years. We've delivered durable growth, world-class innovation and brand building, and improving returns with 17 quarters of record revenue, consistent 35%-plus growth in members and products, four quarters of GAAP profitability, and so many other milestones. There is only one reason available emerge stronger, from such a tumultuous environment. And that reason is that people of SoFi: our employees, our members and our clients. I could not be prouder, or more grateful to the people of SoFi. We now face hopefully, the most advantageous environment that we've seen since I joined the company, and we began the relentless march to be a one-stop shop. Today, we are no longer just a lending company. Today, we are a force to be reckoned with. It is truly our time as we have more products, more members, more capital and more diverse revenue streams than ever before. We are undeniably the absolute best vision company, to capture the massive opportunities still ahead of us, because of the same thing that got us here: our people. Our people are great at heart. Thank you, everyone, for your time today, and we hope you have a great end to 2024.
Maura Cyr: Good bye.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",split transcript is available for premium subscribers only.,SOFI
2025-01-27,"Operator: Good morning or good afternoon all. My name is Adam, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SoFi Technologies Q4 and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. With that, you may begin your conference.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to SoFi's fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results and recent events are Anthony Noto, CEO; and Chris Lapointe, CFO. You can find the presentation accompanying our earnings release on the Investor Relations section of our website. Unless otherwise stated, we'll be referring to adjusted results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024 versus fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations and forecasts and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include, but are not limited to, our competitive advantage and strategy, macroeconomic conditions and outlook, future products and services, and future business and financial performance. Our GAAP consolidated income statement and all reconciliations can be found in today's earnings release and the subsequent 10-K filing, which will be made available next month. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are described in today's press release and our subsequent filings made with the SEC, including our upcoming Form 10-K. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Anthony.
Anthony Noto: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. 2024 was undoubtedly SoFi's best year ever. Our ability to consistently deliver durable growth and strong returns was once again the direct result of our relentless focus on innovation and brand building. I'll begin by covering our key results for 2024, which significantly exceeded our expectations heading into the year. Starting with our durable growth. Members and products are leading drivers of our performance, and we achieved record growth on both fronts. SoFi now has more than 10 million members. That's up 34% year-over-year and up 10x over the past five years. We had another record quarter of new member adds in the fourth quarter at 785,000 new members. In Q4, we also had another record quarter of new product adds at 1.1 million new products, resulting in 32% year-over-year growth to over 14.7 million. Financial Services products drove over 89% of our total product growth. This reflects the deliberate diversification of our business towards more capital-light, fee-based revenue sources, which we expect to continue in 2025. Our strong member and product growth powered record revenue growth in 2024. Adjusted net revenue was $2.6 billion, up 26% year-over-year. Together, our Financial Services and Technology Platform segments generated $1.2 billion of revenue, up 54% year-over-year. These two segments accounted for 47% of our adjusted net revenue, up from 38% last year. It's safe to say SoFi is not just to lender anymore, and we continue to see significant growth opportunity across our Financial Services and Technology Platform segments. In our Lending segment, adjusted net revenue grew 11% to nearly $1.5 billion, well ahead of our initial expectations of being flat to down. This strong growth was driven by record originations of over $23 billion, up 33% from the prior year. Our total fee-based revenue across our business was a record $970 million for the year, up 74% from the prior year. This was driven by strong performance from our origination fees, loan platform business, referrals as well as interchange and brokerage. Importantly, improved monetization continued its strong contribution to growth. Financial Services revenue per product increased from $59 in the fourth quarter of '23 to $81 in the fourth quarter of '24. That's up 37%, and we see continued upside as our newer products mature. In addition to delivering durable growth, we delivered strong returns and profitability. In 2024, adjusted EBITDA was a record at over $665 million. All three of our segments achieved record contribution profit at strong margins. In fact, Financial Services posted its first full year of profitability, and we are still just scratching the surface of the massive opportunity that exists. Our EBITDA margin for the year was 26%, up nearly 500 basis points year-over-year. This improvement was driven by an incremental EBITDA margin of 44%, well above our target of around 30%. Net income was $499 million or $227 million excluding nonrecurring benefits related to deferred taxes, which Chris will discuss momentarily. Even without these benefits, 2024 was our first full year of GAAP profitability, and we have now delivered five consecutive profitable quarters. While we remain focused on achieving our long-term aspirations, we continue to deliver strong performance each day in each quarter. Earnings per share were $0.39 or $0.15 when excluding nonrecurring benefits related to deferred taxes. Intangible book value ended the year at $4.9 billion, a year-over-year increase of nearly $1.4 billion. This includes $271 million from nonrecurring benefits related to deferred taxes. Our strong financial performance is the direct result of our investments in innovation and brand building. These investments attract new members and clients into our ecosystem and lead them to adopt more products over time. This fuels our growth and ultimately our returns as we scale. Looking ahead, our opportunity to scale remains massive, and it feels like it's day one of our journey. People want innovative solutions delivered seamlessly and digitally, yet most traditional financial services firms are encumbered by physical locations, internal bureaucracy and outdated technology. They've struggled to evolve. Since day one, technology and innovation have been part of our DNA. It's how we built and scaled products more rapidly, creating the digital one-stop shop for Financial Services in just seven years. Our members often come to us for a specific product, then adopt others over time. As satisfied members do more with us, it creates a flywheel that we call our Financial Services Productivity Loop. Here's how we know it's working. In 2024, 30% of new products were opened by existing SoFi members, and nearly 40% of new members opened a second product in the first 30 days. More recent cohorts are taking a second product even faster than what we've seen in the past. This performance is a clear indication of our success in getting members to the right product and a validation of our one-stop shop model. Bringing new members into our productivity loop starts by having a trusted household brand name. A key part of our marketing strategy is working with like-minded partners that help us reach new audiences and build awareness of how we help our members get their money right. For example, we recently unveiled a first of its kind partnership where our brand is presented side-by-side with a sports leagues brand in TGL presented by SoFi, a new tech-driven golf league broadcasted live on ESPN from the new state-of-the-art SoFi center in South Florida. Given SoFi is part of the leagues brand, we get millions of impressions everywhere that TGEL brand goes, allowing us to reach a broader audience over and over. Overall, our brand building efforts are yielding strong results. In 2024, our unaided brand awareness reached its highest-ever level at over 7%, up nearly 170 basis points from last year. We are also innovating to strengthen and diversify our business, so we can serve more members with less balance sheet risk, supporting both our growth and returns over the long term. Our loan platform business, or LPB, is one example. Over the years, we've built a powerful lending platform with strong member acquisition, underwriting and servicing capabilities. But prior to 2024, we had two options: hold loans on our balance sheet to generate net interest income; or to sell loans to manage our balance sheet size, risk and capital. This past year, we created greater optionality to meet the strong demands from our members and capital markets buyers through LPB. Here's how it works. We partner with buyers like Fortress to originate loans fitting their predefined criteria, and we earn fee income as we fill the orders. These loans are originated on the buyer's behalf, so they don't sit on our balance sheet. And importantly, we keep the servicing rights. This model is a game changer. It allows us to serve more members, including people that we might have otherwise declined for a variety of factors without taking on incremental risk or capital. It further diversifies our revenue with additional fee-based income; and because we keep the relationship, we have the opportunity to provide the members with additional products and services. In 2024, we originated $2.1 billion of loans through LPB, which brought our total company loan originations to $23 billion. Beyond LPB, we've continued to build and enhance products in our Financial Services segment. In just a few weeks, we'll introduce a variety of new benefits across our one-stop shop and a new fee-based subscription option for SoFi Plus. Our premium membership tier, SoFi Plus, has been incredibly popular, but only available to those members who enroll on direct deposit. For the first time, members can access our highest APY, a 1% match on recurring Invest deposits, extra cash back on SoFi Travel, interest rate discounts and more for a low monthly fee. We will provide SoFi Plus members with more than $1,000 of value annually, unlocked by paying a monthly subscription or doing a monthly direct deposit. In Q4, our investments expanded access to alternative investments through partnerships with three new private market funds, including the Templum Cosmos Fund, which offers sole exposure to SpaceX; and through our new RoboAdvisor platform developed in partnership with BlackRock, Having access to alternative investments is a top priority for many retail investors and one way we’re helping our members achieve their ambitions. SoFi now has 2.5 million invest products, with 70% of the growth coming from existing SoFi members. We continue to iterate on the value proposition, which is driving two dimensions of growth, engagement and monetization, both of which we believe will double in the intermediate term. In Credit Card, we continue to thoughtfully position our business for future growth. We improved our underwriting and rolled out two new products tailored to our members' needs, the Everyday Cash Rewards and Essential Credit Cards, helping more members earn rewards and build their credit. Our Financial Services segment also operates as a marketplace where we connect members to third parties and collect referral fees. For example, we make loan and banking referrals for borrowers we don't currently serve, including small and medium-sized businesses. We also refer members to partner insurance carriers through our Protect products. While still small in the context of SoFi, these referral revenue streams that are high margin grew significantly in 2024. That takes me to SoFi Money, our most successful Financial Services product, which serves as an example of what these other businesses can become. Since 2020, Money has scaled significantly. Products grew from 646,000 to 5.1 million products today and increased 51% just this year. Money helped drive nearly a 9x increase in revenue per product for Financial Services overall. Since acquiring our bank license in 2022, we've grown our deposits to $26 billion by iterating, learning and iterating to make our product, marketing and service better every day. For example, we know that frictionless money movement is top of mind for our members. So in 2024, we introduced Zelle and improved our self-service wire transfers. We believe Invest is the next business to follow the footsteps of Money, and we plan to allocate greater resources in 2025 to scale this business. Turning now to Tech Platform, another fee-based segment. Our Tech Platform gives a broad range of clients, from banks to fintechs to consumer brands, the ability to create, launch and run financial products. In 2024, Tech Platform reached 168 million total accounts, up 15% year-over-year. Entering 2025, we are seeing strong demand from new potential partners. Let me give a few examples from the past few months that demonstrate the diversity of our client base and the strength of our offering. First, we recently were selected by the U.S. Department of Treasury for Direct Express, a prepaid debit card program that approximately 3.4 million people use to access their federal benefits. This is a testament to our Tech Platform's differentiated offering as well as our strength and reliability. We're excited about the integration that will take place in 2025 and the financial impact that we will see in 2026. Second, we just signed a large U.S.-based financial services provider that offers short-term consumer loans, card services, check cashing and other financial products. They've built a large, loyal and highly active debit card portfolio over the past two decades and will now rely on our technology to power existing and new capabilities. Once they fully transition to our platform in early 2026, they will be a top 10 client on a revenue basis. Third, we've signed a partnership with a leading hotel rewards brand for a co-branded debit card program launching in the first half of '25. This is a new differentiated offering that will expand our footprint among consumer brands. These deals represent more predictable revenue from larger established brands with notably higher average deal sizes. We're excited about these wins and would note that the implementation and the integration cycles will be gradual and the revenue impacts will most likely be felt in 2026. As you can see, 2024 was a tremendous year overall. Our record revenue, profit, members, products and returns all demonstrate the success of our innovation and brand building and are a testament to the absolute grit of our team. I have never been prouder of a year-long performance than I am of 2024. Even with how great 2024 was, the future has never been brighter for SoFi than it is in 2025. The operating environment is the strongest it has been since I joined with lower interest rates, strong employment, active capital markets. And we have a vibrant brand and the only digital one-stop shop offering in the U.S., resulting in a diversified business model that is well positioned to capture the opportunity ahead. With that, let me turn the call over to Chris to provide more detail about the quarter and year and to share our detailed guidance for '25.
Chris Lapointe: Thank you, Anthony. 2024 was indeed our best year ever, and we finished strong with an exceptional fourth quarter. Adjusted net revenue for the quarter was a record at $739 million, up 24% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA was also a record at $198 million with a 27% margin. Excluding the nonrecurring benefits related to deferred taxes, adjusted net income was $61 million and adjusted EPS was $0.05. This was our fifth consecutive profitable quarter and first profitable year. As noted, our fourth quarter GAAP results included nonrecurring tax benefits of $271 million. These were primarily related to the release of the majority of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax act. Each quarter, we assess the recoverability of our net deferred assets, most of which are related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards from prior years. The timing of this release was due to our recent strong financial performance and forecast of continued profitability. Moving forward, we expect a normalized effective tax rate of approximately 26%, which can be impacted by future discrete tax items and mix of income. Turning now to our segment performance, starting with our nonlending segment, which comprised a record 49% of total adjusted net revenue during the quarter, reflecting the continued diversification of our business. Starting with Financial Services. For the fourth quarter, net revenue was $257 million, up 84% year-over-year. Contribution profit was $115 million, up 4.6x year-over-year. Contribution margin improved significantly to 45%, up from 18% last year. Net interest income for the segment was $160 million, up 47% year-over-year, which was primarily driven by growth in consumer deposits. Importantly, noninterest income grew 3.2x to $96 million in the quarter, which equates to nearly $385 million in annualized revenue. In Q4, our LPB business generated $63 million in fees, driven by $1.1 billion of personal loans originated on behalf of third parties as well as referrals. Additionally, LPB generated $4 million in servicing cash flow, which is recorded in our Lending segment. In total, our loan platform business added $67 million to our adjusted net revenue across these two segments. We are off to a strong start in Q1 as well. Our loan platform business recently agreed to initial terms with Blue Owl Capital Funds for up to $5 billion of personal loans over two years. Once finalized, this arrangement will represent our largest LPB agreement to date. In addition to our LPB revenue, we continued to see healthy growth in interchange, up 63% year-over-year, driven by $14 billion in total annualized spend in the quarter across Money and Credit Card. Shifting to our Tech Platform. For the fourth quarter, we delivered net revenue of $103 million, up 6% year-over-year. Contribution profit was $32 million at a contribution margin of 31%. Revenue growth was driven by continued monetization of existing clients, along with new deals signed in new client segments. Our recent client wins have been more diverse, including major consumer and commercial brands as well as large enterprises in Latin America. Turning now to our Lending segment. For the fourth quarter, adjusted net revenue was $423 million, up 22% from the same period last year. Contribution profit was $246 million with a 58% adjusted margin. These strong results were primarily driven by growth in net interest income, which increased 31% year-over-year to $345 million. This included a 23% increase in average interest-earning assets and a 68 basis point decrease in cost of funds, which was mostly offset by a 62 basis point decrease in average yields. During the quarter, we achieved record loan originations of $7.2 billion, up 66% year-over-year. Personal loan originations were a record at $5.3 billion, of which $1.1 billion was originated on behalf of third parties through LPB. Collectively, personal loan originations were up 63% year-over-year. Student and home loan lending both had their best quarter since 2021. Student loan originations were $1.3 billion, up 71% from the same period last year. Home loan originations were $577 million, an 87% year-over-year increase. The fourth quarter was our best quarter of capital markets activity since going public. Overall, we sold or transferred through LPB over $3.4 billion of personal loans, home loans and secured loans. In terms of personal loans, we closed $950 million of sales in whole loan form at a blended execution of 105.5%. We also closed a $525 million private ABS transaction that included significantly lower WACC collateral relative to our balance sheet at an execution of 102.3%. All deals had similar structures to other recent personal loan sales with cash proceeds at or near par, and the majority of the premium consisting of contractual servicing fees that are capitalized. These sales included a small loss share provision that is above our base assumption of losses and immaterial relative to the exposure we would have otherwise had if we held the loans. In terms of home loan sales, we closed $507 million at a blended execution of 100.7%. Additionally, we sold $90 million of late-stage delinquent personal loans. By selling these loans, we're able to generate positive incremental value over time versus selling after they charge off, both from our improved recovery capabilities and by maintaining servicing. Finally, we sold $243 million of secured loans at a par execution, while also executing $199 million of new secured financing. Net-net, inclusive of all new issuances, paydowns and loans sold in period, our secured loan balance decreased by $189 million sequentially. Turning to credit performance. The health of our consumer remains strong. Our personal loan borrowers have a weighted average income of $158,000 and a weighted average FICO score of 744, while our student loan borrowers have a weighted average income of $134,000 with a weighted average FICO score of 765. Our credit trends continue to improve after seeing delinquencies peak in the first quarter of '24. For personal loans, the on-balance sheet 90-day delinquency rate was 55 basis points in the quarter, a slight decrease from 57 basis points in Q3. The annualized charge-off rate declined to 3.37% versus 3.52% in the prior quarter. Had we not sold any late-stage delinquencies, we estimate that including recoveries, we would have had an all-in annualized net charge-off rate for personal loans of approximately 4.9% versus 5.0% last quarter. For student loans, the on-balance sheet 90-day student loan delinquency rate remained flat sequentially at 12 basis points, while our annualized charge-off rate decreased 7 basis points to 62 basis points from 69 basis points last quarter. The data continues to support our 7% to 8% maximum life-of-loan loss assumptions for personal loans, in line with our underwriting tolerance, although we continue to trend below these levels. Our recent vintages originated from Q4 2022 to Q1 2024 have net cumulative losses of 3.8% with 45% unpaid principal balance remaining. This is well below the 5.25% observed at the same point in time for the 2017 vintage, the last vintage that approached our 7% to 8% tolerance. The gap between the newer cohort curve and the 2017 cohort curve widened by 15 basis points, demonstrating continued improvement. Additionally, looking at our Q1 2020 through Q3 2024 origination, 58% of principal has already been paid down, with 6.5% in net cumulative losses. Therefore, for life-of-loan losses on its entire cohort of loans to reach 8%, the charge-off rate on the remaining 42% of unpaid principal would be to exceed 10%. This would be well above past levels, further underscoring our confidence in achieving loss rates below our 8% tolerance. Turning to our fair value marks and key assumptions. As a reminder, we mark our loans at fair value each quarter, which considers a number of factors, including: the weighted average coupon; the constant default rate; the conditional prepayment rate; and the discount rate comprised of benchmark rates and spreads. At the end of the fourth quarter, our personal loans were marked at 104.9%, down 80 basis points from the end of the prior quarter. This change was a function of the discount rate increasing by 51 basis points to 5.29% mostly due to the underlying benchmark rate increasing by 63 basis points, partially offset by 12 basis points from spreads tightening. As we've previously noted, both of these changes are empirical based on the actual market data, not assumptions. Additionally, any fair value impacts that resulted from interest rates increasing were offset nearly one for one by hedge gains. Furthermore, we saw a 10 basis point decrease in the weighted average coupon. Slightly offsetting those negative impacts, we had a slight decrease in our conditional prepayment rate from 26.1% to 26.0%, which has an immaterial impact on the overall change in the mark. When a borrower prepays, we are still capturing the principal, and the impact to the value of the asset is only based on the premium above par at a given point in time, which is very small relative to the principal outstanding. At the end of the fourth quarter, our student loans are marked at 104.1%, down 133 basis points from the end of the prior quarter. This change was a function of the discount rate increasing by 41 basis points to 4.4%, driven by the underlying benchmark rate increasing by 76 basis points, partially offset by 35 basis points from spreads tightening. Additionally, we saw a 28 basis point increase in the conditional prepayment rate from 10.7% to 11.0%. There were no material changes to the weighted average coupon rate or the conditional prepayment rate. Turning to our balance sheet, we remain very well capitalized. In the fourth quarter, all assets grew by $1.9 billion, driven by approximately $910 million of loan growth, approximately $830 million of growth in other assets and approximately $80 million of growth in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. Total liabilities grew by $1.5 billion. This was driven by member deposit growth of $2.6 billion quarter-over-quarter, while nonmember deposits were reduced by $1.2 billion. Total deposits reached nearly $26 billion in the quarter. Over the past year, our strong organic deposit growth has further strengthened our balance sheet. Currently, there is 193 basis point difference between the interest we pay on deposits and the interest we pay on warehouse lines, which translates to approximately $500 million in annualized interest expense savings from growing our deposit base over the past year. We continue to benefit from the mix shift towards deposit funding, along with our ability to sustain healthy deposit versus lending betas. As a result, we reported an average net interest margin of 5.91% for the quarter, up 34 basis points sequentially. This is a function of maintaining asset yields and reducing our overall cost of deposits. This continues to be in line with our expectation of maintaining NIM above 5% for the foreseeable future. In terms of our regulatory capital ratios, our total capital ratio of 16.2% at year-end remains comfortably above the regulatory minimum of 10.5%. Tangible book value grew $465 million sequentially to $4.9 billion, including the nonrecurring benefits related to deferred taxes. While these are nonrecurring benefits, it is value retained in the business. Tangible book value per share at year-end is $4.47, up from $3.61 a year ago. Looking forward to 2025, after a year of bolstering our capital base, reaching GAAP profitability as well as the scale required to drive continued profitability, we want to better tilt our incremental revenue growth toward investment. We have significant untapped addressable markets in front of us, and we have proven that the more we invest, the more we produce durable growth and strong returns. In 2025, we plan to manage towards an incremental EBITDA margin of around 30% as we reinvest in the business to drive that durable growth of 25% again in 2025 and, ultimately, strong returns well into the future. Let me finish by providing our outlook for 2025, starting with the macro assumptions that underpin our financial guide. In line with market expectations, our assumptions are as follows: an interest rate outlook consistent with the forward curve and just north of 1.5 rate cuts; GDP expansion of 1% to 2%; normalization of unemployment in the 5% range; and continuation of normalized credit spread across capital markets and stabilization of consumer credit. Now for our specific guidance. For the full year 2025, we expect to add at least 2.8 million members, which represents at least 28% year-over-year growth. We expect adjusted net revenue of $3.20 billion to $3.275 billion, which equates to year-over-year growth of approximately 23% to 26%. We expect an adjusted EBITDA of $845 million to $865 million, which equates to an incremental EBITDA margin of approximately $0.30, in line with our investment philosophy that I just outlined. We expect adjusted GAAP net income in the range of $285 million to $305 million, which equates to an incremental margin of 20% when excluding the 2024 net gain of $63 million related to the exchange of a portion of our 2026 convertible notes for equity. We expect adjusted GAAP EPS in the range of $0.25 to $0.27 per share. As I mentioned, this guidance assumes a tax rate of 26%, which we currently believe to be our effective tax rate in 2025. We expect growth in tangible book value of $550 million to $575 million for the year and to end the year with a total capital ratio above 15%. For the first quarter of 2025, we expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $725 million to $745 million, adjusted EBITDA of $175 million to $185 million, GAAP net income of $30 million to $40 million and GAAP EPS of $0.03. It's important to note two items when comparing Q1 2025 to Q4 2024. First, we expect to have a 26% effective tax rate versus an immaterial impact from taxes on pretax income prior to releasing our valuation allowance. This translates to approximately $15 million of expected taxes in Q1. Second, each year we have seasonal payroll taxes during the first 2.5 quarters of the year. This translates to approximately $10 million of incremental operating expenses in each of the first two quarters. Looking beyond 2025, we now expect to exceed our medium-term guidance of delivering 20% to 25% compounded annual revenue growth through 2026, and we remain confident in delivering 2026 EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.80 per share. Moreover, we are well positioned to deliver 20% to 25% annual EPS growth beyond 2026. Overall, 2024 has been a remarkable year for SoFi. We are proud of the strong results we delivered and remain confident in our ability to build on this momentum as we move into the year ahead. With that, let's begin the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Kyle Peterson from Needham and Co. Kyle, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kyle Peterson: Great. Thanks guys. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. Want to start on the funding side of the equation that, really helped in NIM this quarter. You guys added quite a few deposits. It looks like you've taken a little more action, on the deposit side in terms of lowering AP wise, compared to some of your competitors, but are still growing at a really nice clip here. So just want to see if you could give any more color, on how you guys have been able, to drive back the costs a little more than some peers, despite the perception that we might be in a higher for longer type of environment, than it looks like even three or four months ago?
Anthony Noto: Yes, I'm not sure I understand the question. So clarify, if we don't get it right. I think the first part of your question, was we've lowered interest rates on our APY for SoFi Money, and what impact does that have, and how do we think about our funding costs overall and maintaining them? First on APY, we want to have a top tier APY. It's an important element of our value proposition. SoFi Money has been a phenomenal product. It's the gold standard, of what we're going to do with each one of our businesses. When we started, we had negative unit economics. Then we got the variable profitability, and then from there, we scaled the variable profitability above our contribution. Our cost, the positive contribution margin, and now it's really cranking and we're acquiring a significant number of customers. Obviously the payback period is not instant. So we're funding that within the business, and still driving really high margin. We are seeing really strong trends in growth, with our APY changes that we've made, both in terms of members and deposits. And we think, we can maintain really strong member growth, even if our deposit growth slows. As we think about managing our assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and our funding costs. I'll let Chris add some additional color on the funding side.
Chris Lapointe: Yes, absolutely. So what I would say, is we're now currently at the point, where we're close to our long-term funding target of 85% to 90%. That's been a rate that we've talked about, consistently over the course of the last few years. So while else being equal, we'd like to grow deposits at a similar pace to our overall loans, which we expect to be in the single-digit billions in 2025, which will be slightly less than what we did in 2024. However, as Anthony just noted, if we're seeing exceptionally strong member demand, we can grow a bit faster and deploy that funding, through incremental loans or other assets. Additionally, we have other ways to obviously manage deposits on the balance sheet, through pricing and other means. Finally, the only other point I would note is, that we're still expecting really strong member growth north of 28%. And that's going to be a function, of the continued momentum that we're seeing in money, but also an acceleration in credit card, invest and other financial services products.
Anthony Noto: And I would just make one other point about SoFi Money, and its role strategically in our overall strategy. It's the tip of the sword, so to speak. In the first product many of our members take, and then they gain that trust and reliability with SoFi, and then they take on other products. So the lifetime value from a Money member grows over time as they use more products and services. Which is also a consideration when we think about that product. The last thing I'd say is, what we've seen is that the value prop of SoFi Money is much more than the APY. Having Zelle is really critical. People want a safe, secure way to be able to send money person-to- person. We also provide person-to-person payments via just a phone number email in addition to bill pay, free overdraft, the two-day early paycheck. And we'll continue to add other features and functionalities, to make that really valuable. The reason for SoFi Plus and the subscription, is to actually provide more than $1,000 of value annually, through a subscription of $999 or through direct deposit. And so that value prop will just continue to increase, because we have lower cost, better margin that we can reinvest and greater appeal.
Operator: The next question comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Dan, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Dan Dolev: Hi guys, great results here. And I was going to ask you a question about the lending platform, but we are getting a lot of questions this morning from investors regarding your medium term EPS guidance. So maybe I just. It's really great to see you reiterate the guidance, but now given that you're leaning into investments. Can you give us some examples of like operating leverage items that you, that you have that would, maybe increase the confidence on, investor side that that EPS target can be actually beaten? That would be great?
Anthony Noto: Yes. So I'm going to take a step back and elevate out for a second, to give people perspective. We think the winning formula, is to drive durable growth and strong returns. And we do that by driving innovation and brand building. We couldn't be more confident, in the long-term margins of the business. What we said historically is that our EBITDA margin long-term will be 30%. And our net income margin long-term will be 20%. And we believe we can drive, to a very high ROE well above other financial institutions, with those margins and our high fee-based business, as well as we think about the capital elements of the business. In 2023, we had set guidance with a 30% incremental EBITDA margin. We said our margins long-term would be 30%. So in that time period, we wanted to show evidence of that, and manage the balance of growth and profitability, by delivering a 30% incremental margin. You do that over time, asymptotically, your margin becomes 30%. In 2024, we took a very conservative stance at the same point last year, relative to others based on interest rates, the economy, inflation, geopolitical, et cetera. And because we took that very conservative stance, we drove margin expansion at the expense of revenue growth, and we delivered well more than 30% incremental EBITDA margins, which is evidence that we can do that and maintain growth, having just grown 25%, which is well above the revenue expectations that, we established last year in January. So we couldn't be more confident that our long-term margins, are 30% for EBITDA and 20% for net income. And in 2025, we're just tilting the balance back, to where we're in 23, which is a 30% incremental EBITDA margin. Because that allows us to ensure we're investing today, to drive durable growth beyond today into the future in revenue, in products and in members. The thing that's most important about our guidance, which we just provided, is our revenue expectations are higher in '25, than the street had and what we had previously had. And our revenue expectations for growth into '26, are now higher as well. And that's possible, because the resource we have to invest in the business, and the open opportunity in front of us. So couldn't be more confident in long-term outlook for the company, from a margin standpoint, and want to make sure we're taking a long-term view, to drive revenue growth for as long as we can. And when it slows, then we'll drive the margin growth.
Operator: The next question comes from Terry Ma from Barclays. Terry, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Terry Ma: Hi, thank you. Good morning. I just want to ask about the lending business overall. Your originations in the fourth quarter are quite a bit ahead of our estimates. So I'm just curious how are, you thinking about the lending business in 2025, with respect to originations and balance sheet growth. And then also, what's kind of contemplated in your guide, with respect to the loan platform business?
Chris Lapointe: Absolutely. In terms of the overall revenue growth, for our lending business. What we expect for 2025, is that we're going to grow low double-digits to teens, as we continue to see strong borrower demand, across both our personal and student loans. And we start to scale our home loans business, in a more meaningful way. We now have our back end fulfillment capabilities in place. And we have a full suite of products that, we're able to work with. And then in terms of our medium term guide for the lending business, we're still on track to hit that mid-teens of compound, mid-teens growth compounded 2023 to 2026. As I mentioned before, as it relates to our balance sheet, we're expecting to grow the balance sheet modestly in terms of single-digit billions. But that doesn't mean that we won't be able to grow other parts of the business, at a more rapid pace, through all of our fee-based income streams. In terms of, how we're thinking about the loan platform business going forward, we couldn't be more optimistic about it. We believe the business is just getting started today. We have that $2 billion agreement that, we signed with Fortress last quarter and that relationship continues to expand. And we also agreed, to terms for a $5 billion two-year deal with Blue Owl Capital Funds. As well as having commitments for the rest of 2025 with other partners, including top investment banks, as well as private equity funds. We're obviously one of the very few partners, who has the marketing and operational capabilities to deliver assets at scale, with the characteristics and return profile that investors are seeking. So, really good momentum and demand that we're seeing from loan buyers there.
Operator: The next question comes from John Hecht of Jefferies. John, your line is open. Please go ahead.
John Hecht: Morning guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. I guess just a little bit of attack on from the last response, Chris. The loan platform business, obviously really strong results, really good growth, but also pretty supportive capital markets. How do you guys think about that in a more volatile interest rate, or volatile kind of capital markets environment?
Chris Lapointe: Thanks, John. So what I would say, is we have good visibility into the appetite for our paper, as well as loan buyer demand is remaining extremely strong. As I just mentioned, we have commitments for the rest of 2025 from Fortress, Blue Owl and some of the others that I mentioned. More broadly speaking though, we've built a resilient diversified business with multiple avenues for borrower loan demand, including loans. Holding loans on our balance sheet, selling loans either through whole loan format, or through ABS structures, and referring loans to third-parties. So we're really confident that we'll be able to efficiently monetize the demand that, we're seeing from borrowers today. Additionally, we have other ways that, we can drive fee income growth. You'll continue to see strong growth in interchange, which ended up increasing 63% this quarter. Also the brokerage business, as we continue to improve our monetization within Invest, and then fees related to tech platform, and fees from our new SoFi Plus offering that Anthony discussed during the prepared remarks.
Anthony Noto: And one of the things that we broke out in our prepared remarks, in case anyone missed it, is that we're now providing a perspective on what our total fee-based revenue, was across all of our businesses. And for the year it was $970 million, which was up 74%. And again that's driven by origination fees, loan platform business, referrals as well as interchange and brokerage. And for those that may not be familiar with the accounting, the loan platform business cash up front, as opposed to gain on sale accounting. So it has an additional characteristic to it that's very favorable for us, especially on the credit and capital side.
Operator: The next question comes from Mihir Bhatia from Bank of America. Mihir, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Mihir Bhatia: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I was just wondering if you could provide, as we think about 2025, maybe provide a little bit more on your expectations at a segment level, both from a revenue, but also a contribution margin standpoint. Particularly curious about the Financial Services segment, where I think Anthony said it might be - in the Invest business, there's going to be some investments there. So just trying to understand how those evolve next year? Thank you.
Chris Lapointe: Absolutely. So overall, we're expecting 23% to 26% revenue growth this year. We now expect to exceed our medium-term guidance that, we laid out at the beginning of last year of 20% to 25% compounded annual growth, so we're really optimistic about the opportunity that we have ahead of us. In terms of the specific segment level guidance, for Financial Services, we're expecting very strong growth in the range of 60% to 65%. As we continue to grow products and overall monetization. But we're currently trending well ahead of our medium-term 23% to 26% guide of 50% annually, and now we expect closer to around 65% over that same period. For lending, as I just mentioned, we're expecting to grow 2025 low double-digits to teens, as we continue to see good demand, both on the personal loans and student loan side and we start scaling home loans. In terms of the medium-term guide for lending, we're still on track for the mid-teens growth 2023 through 2026. And then for Tech Platform, we expect to grow 2025 low double-digits to teens. And given that lead times and implementation cycles, have been longer than expected, we now expect to grow revenue at a mid-teens CAGR, from 2023 to 2026. In terms of the margin profile, you can expect Financial Services, we're at about a 45% margin and $81 of annualized revenue per product. We're still under monetized in Invest, so there's opportunity. And we're starting to scale our loan platform business, which is generating margins around 50% slightly north of that. So you could expect to see continued margin expansion in that business. Within lending, we've been consistently in mid-50s to mid-60s range. You could expect that trend to persist going forward. And then from a Tech Platform perspective, we expect healthy margins in the 30% range in the medium term.
Anthony Noto: And then just elaborating on the investments that we're going to make in the Financial Services. We announced, obviously launching at the end of this month, SoFi Plus. That's going to expand the availability, of this great value equation of more than $1,000 in annual value to more full, especially those that may have direct deposit capabilities, because they're self-employed. But also other people that are younger, and aren't actually in the workforce today. It's a great value for the price point on a monthly basis, and you more than recoup your subscription fee for the year. So that will have a significant amount of investment. In addition to that, we really want to accelerate our growth in Invest. We think it's the next business like Money to follow the same path. It's well on its way. But it's still really early days. We've seen great growth in all the key metrics there in terms of account openings, fundings, average deposits per account, average assets per account and our monetization is also improving there, so we'll continue to get those dual drivers of growth. In addition to that, we've invested in small and medium business capabilities, over - in 2024. We fully integrated the application process into our app, the SoFi app, and we're using partners to fulfill that demand for loans, and that's grown quite nicely. Similar approach to our insurance business, which we call Protect. home, auto and life, also a big contributor where we want to grow much faster than it saw a really good growth in '24. Small relative to SoFi overall, but a big area for us. And then last, our Credit Card business, we'll be very methodical about our approach there. We think we have the right formula. But it is a business that you have to really manage methodically given the J-curve investment. And so that will continue to be losing significant amounts of money in the tens of millions of dollar range. So significant investment to make sure, we have continuous S curves of growth beyond 2025. And the formula is really working. We said on the call that, we 30% of our products are from existing members, and 40% of our members take a second product within 30 days. So we want that flywheel to keep flying.
Operator: Next question comes from Reggie Smith from JPMorgan. Reggie, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Reggie Smith: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I want to dig in to the loan platform business a little bit. I think you guys said that those are primarily loans that did not meet SoFi standards, at least today. Was curious if this could become a channel, where you do sell loans that are higher quality to partners? And then secondarily, do you charge origination fees on those platform loans? Thank you.
Anthony Noto: Let me answer the first one, and I'll turn it over to Chris. It should be clear to everyone that, we are actually selling loans that are high quality, but we're also selling loans that are outside our credit box, and they are also high quality. So there are two things that caused us to do the loan platform business. One, someone wants a credit profile that's actually within our credit box. But it's at volumes that we wouldn't otherwise produce. And so once we have the commitment from them, we'll go out and originate that volume, leveraging our origination platform, our underwriting platform, marketing and servicing platform, and get paid a fee for that. So there's two things that drive it. One, someone will want above what we would actually produce ourselves, and look to sell, that's within our credit box. And two, things are outside of our credit box. So it's both of those criteria. And in our view, they're all high quality. Some of them are more high quality, i.e., prime profile which is what our profile is. I'll turn to Chris on the fee side.
Chris Lapointe: Yes. In terms how of we think about structuring these deals, all of the deals where we're doing originations on behalf of third-parties consists of two components. We have a flat fee per loan that we receive upfront at time of transfer. We not only get the flat fee from the, those that we are originating on behalf of. But we also charge origination fees for a portion of the loans that we're originating. And then, we also get a modest servicing fee that, gets capitalized at the time of transfer. Both of those are recognized under non-interest income.
Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from William Blair. Andrew, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hi, good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. Anthony, great to see the mix shift in revenue and the rise in fees as a percent of the total. Can you, sort of looking longer term, talk about perhaps where you'd like to see fees as a percent of the total, given your long-term ROE aspirations, and what the composition of that fee-based business might look like, say, either in an intermediate term time frame, or even a little longer time frame?
Anthony Noto: Yes. It's really hard to give you a specific number, given it's being driven by five different sources of revenue. We would want it to be very significant. We recognize that it's capital light, it's less credit risk obviously, and it's cash upfront so it's also a high ROE. We want to grow it as large as we can. One of the things that we contemplate, is could we push all of our lending into the loan platform business over time. And I'm not opposed to that at all. The economics are very attractive. The velocity is much higher, the capital is lower. You have a lighter balance sheet, it would really support higher ROE. Listen, we're students of the industry, and we see what drives high multiples of whether it's revenue or earnings or book value, whatever the multiple may be, it's high ROE. So we have, I think, a great mix of businesses that we've told you will have a high ROE. The more we can drive fee revenue, the more visible that will be come to you. So it was $970 million in the year. I hope it continues to increase as a percent of the mix, which I think it will, based on our outlook. So you'll continue to see it increase, and the benefit that I just mentioned.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Adelson from Morgan Stanley. Jeff, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jeff Adelson: Hi, good morning, Anthony and Chris. You've talked a lot about the opportunity in SoFi Invest following the footsteps of SoFi Money, and it sounds like the SoFi Plus enhancements, are a key product strategy. But any other specifics into your plans to really ramp up that business? Like is it really just about allocating more marketing, and generating more awareness? Or are there any other features that we should be expecting? And maybe just talk a little bit about, sizing the monetization. Like I think you're only doing, on a quarterly basis, about $6 million of brokerage revenues there. And then just sort of related to that, does that include any potential plans for maybe a reentry into crypto, just given the current administration's thinking around that? Thank you.
Anthony Noto: So first, I would say the same thing about investors to the rest of our business. The biggest gate to our growth, is awareness and becoming a household trusted brand name. And so, we're super focused on driving unaided brand awareness, of the business overall and for each one of the products. And SoFi Invest itself. 7% of SoFi Invest products - growth in the quarter, are coming from existing members. So the biggest driver for SoFi Invest, is investing in broader awareness to our existing members, but also outside the platform. And so it's a great value proposition. We're differentiating them fast on selection, on content and convenience, and we'll keep iterating on those four variables, as well as products working better together. But the biggest driver of growth, given we do have a really an attractive value prop. Is driving more awareness of the product, to members and non-members. We have over 10 million members now. You can see how many products we have in Invest. We haven't even penetrated our member base, the way that I think we can in addition to going outside the walls. But we will continue to add more and more selection. This quarter, we added more alternative assets. Alternative assets were originally launched at the beginning of '24. It had a pretty big impact on the growth of both accounts, funded accounts and AUM. Because like a grocery store, people come in for the milk, and they see everything else that's there, and so it has an indirect benefit that's really paid dividends. And so, we'll continue to invest in that business, both directly as well as part of SoFi Plus. And there's a lot of features and functional that we don't offer today that will continue to add value and differentiation.
Chris Lapointe: And then on your point - your question on crypto. Listen, when we architected SoFi Invest, one of our differentiators was we wanted to SoFi Invest, to be a one-stop shop on its own. So we launched with no commission equities, we pioneered fractional shares. We created ETFs at a $10 price point, because we wanted our members to have a diverse portfolio. They can invest in a dollar cost way, and $10 was a great price point to do that in S&P 500 types of index ETFs. In addition to that, we have our robo accounts. We pioneered IPOs in a turnkey way. We've added alternative assets. When we launched, we really debated do we need crypto, do we not need crypto. We went out to our member base back in 2018, did a survey to our member base. And they absolutely want crypto, and we provided it in a safe and sound way, and a responsible way. As the regulation changes, we will be incredibly aggressive, tied to crypto, and being as many businesses as we can be across the entire platform. Previously, we're just doing trading. You can see us go well beyond that, depending on the regulation, including costing and clearing, trading platforms, asset-backed lending and so many other areas. So, we hope the administration, and the regulators come up with clarity on what the outlook will be, but we'll move as aggressively as anyone else once that is determined.
Operator: At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Anthony Noto for closing remarks.
Anthony Noto: Thank you, and thank you for everyone for joining the call today. Over the past seven years, we faced challenge after challenge in the internal environment impacting our business, our members and our team. In each time, through our innovation and tenacity, we'll be able to run to daily and come out even stronger than before. The result is a more diversified, resilient, battle-tested business and most importantly a gritty team that finds a way to win. As I've said before, we love hard. Hard is the path to durability. Hard is the path to differentiation. And hard is the path of being the absolute best. We entered 2025 with the best business environment we've had in my time at SoFi. But regardless of that outlook, rest assured, we are battle ready. And while I'm confident our best days are yet to come, you should rest assured we will work harder, and smarter than ever before to be the best in everything we do, and to continue to build the SoFi way. Thank you for your interest and support in our great company.

2024,Q1,2024-04-30,"Operator: Good morning. My name is Sarah, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to PayPal Holdings' Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter 2024. [Operator Instructions] 
 I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ryan Wallace, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Ryan Wallace: Good morning. Thank you for joining PayPal's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today is Alex Chriss, our President and CEO; and Jamie Miller, our CFO.  
 We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast. Both the presentation and call are available on our Investor Relations website.  
 In discussing our company's performance, we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call.  
 Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on our website. All information in this presentation is as of today's date. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information.  
 And with that, let me turn the call over to Alex. 
James Chriss: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. This quarter, we delivered a solid set of results, and the year is off to a good start. Our new leadership team is operating well together, and we are really starting to get our arms around the business. You will see in our numbers and the read-through that our efforts are beginning to make a difference. We also see substantial need for continued retooling of the company, how we work with our customers and how we execute. We are encouraged by the progress to date but remain realistic that we still have a lot of work to do and a lot of opportunity to drive profitable growth ahead of us.  
 What we said at the start of the year still holds. This is a transition year where we are focused on execution and making critical choices that will set the business up for long-term success. We have a plan that will return this company to where it needs to be and remain focused on execution to get there. We see clear opportunities for operational improvements across our large enterprise, small business and consumer businesses, including Venmo, and in driving more efficiency across the organization. But it will take time to prudently drive a meaningful and sustainable transformation.  
 In the first quarter, we delivered 10% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis on $404 billion in total payment volume. Transaction margin dollar performance grew 4%, which was better than expected, thanks in part to actions we took. Our non-GAAP earnings per share increased 27% year-over-year. 
 Our results are stronger than we expected earlier in the year, and they require some unpacking to put them in the context of the full year. What I want you to understand is what we are focused on, namely, making surgical changes to the way we are running the company. Some of these will have an immediate impact and others will take longer to bear fruit. As such, we need to maintain flexibility throughout this year to make important decisions to drive the long-term growth of the business. This includes decisions about where we prioritize and reinvest, how we go to market and actions that can be taken to sharpen our value proposition for consumers and merchants.  
 With that in mind, we do now expect full year EPS to grow mid- to high single digits, which is partially driven by our better-than-expected start to the year. Jamie will take you through our Q1 results, contours of the year and updated guidance in just a few moments. Let me first spend some time providing an update on our execution against our customer strategies and investment priorities and detail progress on our efforts to operate more efficiently.  
 Turning to our 3 customer groups. We continue to make steady progress on strengthening our strategic positioning and product portfolio. For large enterprises, we continue to focus on accelerating growth in branded checkout and driving the profitability of our business.  
 We are executing to get upgrades to our core branded checkout experiences to the market. We continue to make good progress in our early testing of Fastlane by PayPal with a focused group of merchants. And data from those alpha merchants show that returning Fastlane users are converting at nearly 80%. We are just getting started and already creating a low double-digit lift in guest checkout conversion for participating merchants. The results so far are encouraging as incremental conversion improves our merchants' growth and profits. Demand for this product is promising, and we expect to make Fastlane generally available in the U.S. in the second half of the year.  
 Additionally, we are continuing to focus on making it even easier to pay with PayPal by removing friction from the checkout process. In the coming months, we will continue to move to more passwordless authentication processes, like biometrics, and launch a redesigned mobile checkout experience, which we believe will result in higher conversion rates.  
 We've begun active discussions with our largest enterprise customers to focus on commercial outcomes that reflect the true value of our payments processing platform and the services we provide. As we speak, many of our top merchants are gathered in California for our annual Commerce 360 Customer Conference, where our teams will go deep on the innovations we plan to bring to market this year and the value they can provide.  
 We are also in the early stages of evaluating the overall dynamics and pipeline of our top 10,000 merchant accounts. As we evaluate our programs, we see clear opportunities to price to value, not only with our PSP processing, but especially with our value-added services that we already provide, services such as payouts, fraud prevention and processing orchestration. 
 This process will take time, but we have a focused game plan, and we are already having fruitful conversations that are helping merchants understand the additional value they can unlock by strengthening their relationship with us, including through our value-added services.  
 For example, DraftKings recently went live with our fraud management solution, Fraud Protection Advanced, which combines our intelligence with advanced machine learning and analytics to help businesses protect themselves from ever-evolving fraud threats. This is an example of a best-in-class offering and a key differentiator against our competitors. It also showcases our ability to leverage AI to drive customer benefit and is an area where we can price to the value we provide.  
 For small- and medium-sized businesses, the launch of our PayPal Complete Payments Platform has been gaining momentum over the past couple of quarters. We've made good progress in expanding PPCP's geographic reach to now more than 34 countries. In the first quarter, we expanded the platform to Canada, the U.K. and more than 20 European markets. We also added new features to PPCP in Australia, Germany and the U.S. in recent months. Additionally, we are seeing positive response to our new low- and no-code tools for merchants and developers to integrate PPCP, which we launched in March. 
 As of the end of the first quarter, approximately 7% of our SMB volume is already on PayPal Complete Payments, with our team focused on distribution through partners that can accelerate adoption to the largest number of customers. Our efforts here are important because PPCP ensures merchants have our latest branded checkout integration, which will include Fastlane, so that consumers have a best-in-class checkout experience wherever they shop, and merchants will benefit from higher conversion.  
 On average, merchants who adopt PPCP use approximately 4 PayPal products, which deepens the relationship and reduces churn. This translates to an average revenue per account for our PPCP full-stack merchant that is nearly 2x that of an SMB on a legacy integration.  
 As you all know, I have a deep passion for helping small businesses succeed. Frankly, this is an area where PayPal took its eye off the ball. Over the years, we've deprecated products and made pricing decisions that negatively affected our market positioning. Despite that, we still have the largest population of SMBs anywhere, who are using our products and eager for us to do more for them. This is an area where we are investing to correct our course. We are here to serve and win the small business market.  
 On the consumer front, the PayPal app is at the center of our strategy to leverage the power of our data to create more value for our customers and unlock new sources of revenue and margin expansion opportunities. In the first quarter, we revamped the PayPal app with a new look and feel and introduced enhancements to our rewards program to enable shoppers to get the most out of their money while increasing conversion for merchants. 
 Additionally, we began testing a comprehensive rewards-focused life cycle marketing program. When tested with approximately 20% of our PayPal app users, we saw it drive a nearly 7% increase in weekly app logins and 4% increase in transaction margin per user.  
 Introducing consumers to new products, like our debit card that can help maximize the value they receive from PayPal, is a major focus. The enhancements our team made to our onboarding flow enabled a 38% increase in debit card first-time users during the first quarter. On average, a customer who adopts the PayPal debit card is more engaged, generating a 2x lift to transaction activity and a nearly 20% increase to average revenue per account compared to users who primarily use checkout. Approximately 4% of our active PayPal consumer accounts in the U.S. have a debit card. So while we have a lot more to do, this work is meaningful to the economics of our business.  
 In the quarter, we onboarded BigCommerce and WooCommerce to our package tracking solution. In the 12 months since launch, we've had approximately 7 million active accounts use package tracking. This is a key pillar in our post-purchase strategy. Package tracking not only allows consumers to track their shipments within the PayPal app, but will also enable us to make personalized purchase recommendations and present relevant offers through the app and our AI-powered Smart Receipts. We believe these innovations will drive engagement with the PayPal app and incentivize future branded checkout activity.  
 For Venmo, we are focused on giving our customers more ways to immediately use their Venmo debit card in person with Apple Pay and Google Pay, which you will see in the market in the coming months. In the first quarter, we saw a 21% year-over-year increase in consumers using our Venmo debit card. Remember, Venmo debit cardholders are among the most engaged accounts and on average drives 6x the incremental revenue than that of a P2P-only customer. Simultaneously, we are making it easier for consumers to use their Venmo balance when making payments or sending money to friends. In the first quarter, balance-funded P2P senders grew by 17%, which contributed to our overall transaction margin dollar growth in the quarter.  
 Our leadership team is continuing to go through our business from top to bottom, understanding where we can operate more efficiently and invest in the innovation that will offer the greatest impact for our customers and PayPal. This is a mindset shift we are driving throughout the entire organization. Investing for durable growth backed by a clear payback path and time horizon remains a top priority. Investing in branded checkout and better serving our small business customers are 2 focus areas you heard me talk about today.  
 We are also actively evaluating and greenlighting new investments to accelerate future growth that support and strengthen our strategic priorities. A good example of this is our remittance business, Xoom, which has stagnated while similar services have gained share. This business has been on a negative revenue trajectory due to a lack of prioritization and clarity about its value proposition. That is now changing. 
 We are executing the right product refinements bundled with an enhanced and more customizable pricing model intended to promote growth over the long run. We plan to reduce the cost of cross-border transfers and provide consumers the option to eliminate transaction fees altogether when funding with our PYUSD stablecoin. We are activating those plans, and we expect to see tangible progress throughout 2024 and beyond.  
 The key takeaway here is that we are in the process of assessing a handful of areas of investment where we believe there are compelling unit economics and market upside. These may mean that we will make decisions to invest in 2024 where we believe these investments will ultimately contribute to the sustainable and profitable growth of the company. At the same time, we must maintain our focus. We are continuing to evaluate the markets we operate in and the products we offer. Where we see areas to improve focus and prioritization, we will take action and update you accordingly.  
 Finally, a few words on our continued efforts to drive operational efficiency and productivity across PayPal. We are instilling a rigorous cost/benefit discipline throughout the company and leaving no stone unturned when it comes to reducing unproductive costs. We are also investing in automation that will help answer our customers' frequently asked questions, simplify the integration process for our merchants and enable our team to deploy solutions more quickly. 
 As mentioned on the last earnings call, we have started reporting stock-based compensation as part of our non-GAAP metrics beginning this quarter. In addition to our annual incentive plan, shifting to cash payment from stock, we have also better aligned our incentive programs to performance, particularly focusing on transaction margin and non-GAAP operating income growth. We will continue to focus on a pay-for-performance culture that appropriately aligns pay with results.  
 I'll conclude by thanking the PayPal team for continuing to innovate and serve our customers. While we are still in the early innings of driving a meaningful and comprehensive transformation of PayPal to deliver the sustainable and high-quality growth we are aiming for, our first quarter results are an encouraging indication of what our team's renewed strategic focus and persistent execution can achieve. We will continue to update you on our execution throughout the year and be transparent about our progress. I am confident that we are taking the right steps to build long-term profitable growth.  
 With that, I'll hand it over to Jamie to take you through our first quarter results. 
Jamie Miller: Thanks, Alex. Good morning, everyone. We had a solid start to the year with first quarter results that were above our expectations. As Alex mentioned, it's still early in the company's transformation. We are getting deeper in understanding both our challenges and our opportunities with much greater clarity. 
 Our goal for 2024 is to foundationally set up the business for the future by making key decisions and aligning our investment path for growth. And to do so, we are laser-focused on strategic analysis and decision-making, driving innovation back into the business and executing with excellence. While it will take time for our efforts to sustainably flow through results, the speed at which the team is moving is encouraging, and we are making steady progress. 
 Let me start with a summary of our financial performance. As a reminder, our non-GAAP results now include the impact of stock-based compensation expense and related payroll taxes. This change is intended to enhance transparency, operating discipline and align our performance measures to how many investors already evaluate our business. 
 Now moving to our results. As Alex mentioned, in the first quarter, revenue increased 9% at spot and 10% on a currency-neutral basis. Transaction margin dollars grew 4% year-over-year, improving in growth by more than 400 basis points from the fourth quarter. I'll walk through the drivers of that growth in a few minutes and provide context on the shape of the year, including tailwinds that we expect to be more pronounced in the first half compared to the second half. 
 Under our updated non-GAAP methodology, earnings per share were $1.08, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Under the company's prior non-GAAP methodology, which excluded the impact of stock-based compensation, earnings per share would have increased approximately 20% to $1.40, above our guidance for mid-single-digit growth on a comparable basis. 
 Relative to our outlook, higher earnings per share were driven by a combination of factors, including better-than-expected transaction margin dollars, ongoing expense discipline, the timing of certain investment in marketing spend and interest income. 
 Now I'll walk through some key operating metrics that support those results. We ended the first quarter with 427 million total active accounts and 220 million monthly active accounts. Total active accounts increased by nearly 2 million from the fourth quarter and included growth in PayPal merchant and consumer accounts in addition to other products. We were encouraged to see total active accounts inflect positively in the quarter, and we remain focused on driving deeper relationships and more activity across our customer base. 
 Monthly active accounts continued to show steady progress, up 2% year-over-year to 220 million with contribution from both PayPal and Venmo. Transactions per active account, which is a trailing 12-month number, was 60 in the first quarter, up 13%. Excluding PSP processing, which is primarily Braintree, transactions per active account grew 7%. 
 Moving to volume growth. In the first quarter, TPV grew 14% on a spot and currency-neutral basis to $403.9 billion. U.S. TPV grew 12%. International TPV grew 17% on a currency-neutral basis primarily driven by strength in Continental Europe and improvement in Asia. 
 Global branded checkout growth accelerated to 7% on a currency-neutral basis from 5% in the fourth quarter. The first quarter included about a 1 point benefit from leap day as well as ongoing benefits from the growth of global marketplaces. 
 Within branded checkout, large enterprise and international markets were the biggest contributors to growth. We remain laser-focused on driving deeper adoption of our best-in-class solutions with small- and medium-sized businesses and improving mobile experience, which are critical, particularly in markets like the U.S. and the U.K. PSP processing volume grew 26% in the quarter driven by continued momentum from Braintree compared to 29% in the fourth quarter. 
 Conversations with merchants have been encouraging as we shift our focus to a more disciplined go-to-market and renewal process that emphasizes a focus on profitable growth. Merchants recognize the product and performance improvements we have already started to make and are excited about the pipeline of upcoming innovation. 
 As I noted earlier, revenue in the first quarter increased 9% at spot and 10% on a currency-neutral basis to $7.7 billion. Transaction revenue grew 11% on a spot basis to $7 billion driven by Braintree and branded checkout. Other value-added services revenue in the quarter declined 2% on a spot basis to $665 million. 
 Within other value-added services, interest on customer balances continued to be a meaningful tailwind. Our credit business performed relatively in line with our expectations with revenue lower because of 2 main factors. First, we are carrying lower merchant receivables after tightening originations last year. Second, we have had lower revenue share on our off-balance sheet U.S. consumer revolving credit portfolio due to ongoing normalization of loss rates. 
 Transaction take rate declined 5 basis points to 1.74% driven primarily by lower foreign exchange fees and lower gains from foreign currency hedges. In addition, mix shift to large merchants continued to impact our branded checkout take rate. Transaction margin dollars increased 4% in the first quarter. Higher interest on customer balances, branded checkout, better transaction loss performance and lower credit losses were the largest contributors to growth. 
 While the performance of the core business has been relatively consistent, we expect that a few of these tailwinds are likely to be less meaningful as we move through the year. Specifically, we expect to see lower year-over-year benefit from interest on customer balances and lower year-over-year improvement on transaction and loan loss performance. 
 Non-transaction-related operating expenses declined 2% as we continue to actively manage our cost structure while reinvesting into key strategic initiatives. Part of the decline in operating expenses is a result of certain corporate and marketing investments deferred to the second half as well as lower stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating income grew 15% in the quarter to $1.4 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded 84 basis points to 18.2%. 
 PayPal generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter or $1.9 billion, excluding the impact of held-for-sale accounting related to our European Buy Now, Pay Later externalization. In the quarter, we completed $1.5 billion in share repurchases, bringing share repurchases over the past 12 months to approximately $5.1 billion. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $17.7 billion and debt of $11 billion. 
 I'll now move to our second quarter and 2024 guidance. Consistent with the approach we shared in February, we will continue to provide revenue guidance 1 quarter at a time. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to increase approximately 6.5% at spot and 7% on a currency-neutral basis. In addition, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to increase by a low double-digit percentage. 
 For the full year, we continue to plan for a relatively consistent macroeconomic and consumer spending environment. With respect to earnings per share, we now expect 2024 non-GAAP EPS to grow by a mid- to high single-digit percentage. 
 As Alex said earlier, we are in a transition year, and we do not expect that our quarterly progression will be linear. To help bridge this outlook compared to our prior guidance for approximately flat non-GAAP EPS, there are 2 main factors I would point you to. 
 First, our inclusion of stock-based compensation expense within non-GAAP results is expected to benefit EPS growth by approximately 3 percentage points this year. Second, we saw meaningful outperformance in the first quarter relative to our plans. We intend to reinvest a portion of this performance back into the business. 
 We expect earnings growth to be more muted in the second half of the year due primarily to less benefit from interest income on customer balances, normalization in transaction and loan loss performance as we progress through the year and the expected timing of investment actions. 
 Underpinning our outlook, we now expect transaction margin dollars to be slightly positive for the full year. We expect non-transaction operating expenses to increase slightly. Embedded within this outlook is the flexibility to make key strategic decisions to invest and reinvigorate profitable growth within components of the portfolio and accelerate go-to-market efforts. 
 For the full year, we expect other value-added services revenue to be roughly flat year-over-year. This excludes any potential impact from the CFPB late fee regulation, given pending litigation across the banking industry and uncertainty on both timing and implementation. As a company, we have already taken steps to mitigate the future impact, though these take time to fully take hold. 
 Consistent with the approach we shared last quarter, our guidance includes minimal impact from the new innovations rolling out this year. Our focus is on execution as we begin moving from test and pilot phases into launch. We continue to expect free cash flow for 2024 to be approximately $5 billion and for at least $5 billion in share buybacks. 
 In closing, 2024 is off to a solid start as we drive significant change across the company. We have clear opportunities to lean in further. We are doing the hard work now to position PayPal for profitable growth in the years ahead, and it has been incredibly energizing to see the team's commitment to this goal. 
 With that, I'll now hand it back to the operator to begin Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. 
Tien-Tsin Huang: Just I wanted to ask on transaction margin dollars, if you don't mind, the acceleration there. Maybe can you give us a little bit more detail on the growth across the main businesses, branded checkout, unbranded and what we've been calling other? And of course, on the other side, love to hear if there's any change in thinking there on the strategy to reclaim growth or even divest some of those assets. 
James Chriss: Yes. Thank you, Tien-Tsin. Let me hand it over to Jamie to walk you through transaction margin, and then I'll take the more strategic piece on other and how we think about the year. 
Jamie Miller: I'll just walk you through the drivers for transaction margin growth during the quarter. We were happy with the positive growth progression. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got a lot underway to really position the company for positive TM growth over time. 
 In the quarter, just to walk it a little bit, interest income on customer balances was the highest contributor. Branded checkout continued to grow profitably and was a nice contributor to our growth this quarter. We did benefit from leap day, but we also benefited from strength in large enterprise and international. We've been very focused this year on PSP profitability, and that will ramp over time, but it wasn't a meaningful contributor this quarter. And we just had small but I'd say steady ongoing product improvements in Venmo and P2P. So we saw some shifting there and better transaction and credit loss performance. And then lastly, to the last point of your question, we did see a smaller drag from the other smaller parts of the portfolio. 
 I don't know, Alex, do you want to talk through that a little bit. 
James Chriss: Yes. Let me just sort of take a step back, Tien-Tsin, and talk about how we've been thinking about the year. You've heard us talk about this as a transition year. The way we've really been focusing the team is on sort of 3 different components to make sure that we're set up well for profitable growth into the future. 
 The first is accelerating innovation and ensuring that we've got best-in-class innovation, whether that's on the consumer side and ensuring that our customers have a frictionless, incredible experience in checkout; to an unbranded side where we allow our merchants to have, again, best processing available. So really accelerating the velocity of our innovation. 
 The second is adoption and ensuring that once that innovation is actually in the market, that our consumers are using it, that our merchants are onboarding to our latest and greatest integrations. I'll give you an example. We talked about in the last call the opportunity for debit card engagement. We changed the onboarding flow inside of the PayPal app this past quarter and saw a 69% higher debit card engagement just by changing that flow. So a big focus on the team on not just delivering our innovation but actually delivering the adoption. 
 And then lastly, as you mentioned, cleaning up some of our underperforming services. I mentioned Xoom on the call. That is a business that we looked at very hard. It's been underperforming for a couple of years now. And we wanted to make a decision on, is this an asset that's strategic to the business that should be a profitable grower for us, or not? And when we looked at it, we realized that there were just opportunities where we had priced ourselves out of the market in a number of different corridors that we could make strategic decisions on and actually make this a profitable, growing business. 
 And so that's just an example. We're going top to bottom throughout the organization. And there will be some businesses or markets that don't meet that cut, and we'll let you know when we make those decisions. And there will be other ones that, with focus and execution, we'll turn around. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. 
Darrin Peller: I think it would be helpful, if you don't mind, just first revisiting some of the initiatives around unbranded and your conviction and the timing around the impact from them on -- perhaps on transaction margin. 
 But maybe even more specifically, if you've had discussions with Braintree merchants around pricing, and I think you touched on this in the prepared remarks, but more pricing to value than pricing to win, how are those conversations going? 
 And I guess, Alex, market-wide, when we think about the appreciation of the value-added services and differentiator for PayPal's 2-sided network, how has that been resonating in the market lately? 
James Chriss: Yes. Thank you, Darrin. So again, just to sort of paint the high picture on unbranded, this is an important segment for us, both on -- for enterprise and for small business. We have to nail the basics, right? So our customers are looking for the best auth rates, the best uptime, the best availability, the best reliability. And those are things that we are now providing. 
 And I think over the last few years, as we've been building the service, whether it's Braintree or now with PPCP, we've been investing in that and establishing a beachhead for our product across the market. In doing so, though, we also have been building value-added services that, to be totally transparent, we haven't been able to price to value or we haven't been able to ensure that we're engaged with our customers in a real end-to-end strategic conversation. That's changing now. 
 And so to your question, we're having great conversations with both enterprise and small business merchants around our end-to-end solutions, the value-added services that we can now bring to bear, really more strategic conversations, as you mentioned, around the 2-sided network, both on unbranded, on branded, and then even things like our new marketing and ad platform in the mix. We're now having really deep conversations with our merchants that, again, are strategic for them and extract the value that -- of the services that we're providing. 
 So very encouraged with these conversations. Obviously, it's going to take time. Especially for some of the largest merchants, it just takes time for them to roll out and adopt. But our teams right now are, as I mentioned on the call, in L.A. with our Customer 360 conference and showing them all the innovations and having really, really good conversations. So encouraged with the start. It's just going to take time throughout the year. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo with UBS. 
Timothy Chiodo: I wanted to [indiscernible], 2 parts really, one around mechanics, one around the uplift. On the mechanics, there might be 2 ways to go about this. One is to make it a part of your unbranded offering, and it could be either part of your negotiations on pricing, it could be a separate fee. But any way you look at it in that scenario, would be more of an, if Fastlane, then Braintree does the processing. But the alternative way would for it to be more of an as-a-service and available on a processor-agnostic basis. Wanted to see, first, if you can give us color on which routes you might be able to take, or maybe both.
 And then lastly, on the uplift, which is if we think about the range of net take rates with unbranded at the low end and branded at the high end, where do you think Fastlane could eventually reside on that spectrum? 
James Chriss: Yes. Thanks, Tim. Let me take the first part and see if Jamie wants to add anything in. We are really excited about Fastlane as it now gets to market. We are live with a handful of early partners, and the results just continue to impress. 
 And just as a reminder, we're now enabling 80% conversion rate for returning users through our guest checkout flow. What's even more exciting, that we've now been able to start to see with these early merchants, is that we're actually seeing unrecognized users, so these are non-PayPal users, opting in to Fastlane at a 40% rate. 
 That just shows the power of our brand, and it shows the power of what PayPal can be. And it goes a little bit to your question around how we think about pricing it and how we think about go-to-market because it's even beyond just an unbranded processing element. I don't want to unveil exactly how our go-to-market will work. But that data point shows that this is not just within a PayPal ecosystem. This is allowing us to actually take the brand that we've established over 25 years and leverage that for our merchants to deliver incredible checkout conversion rate for the 60% of the market that continues to go through a guest checkout experience. So we're really encouraged by the early signs there. 
 In terms of rollout and how we think about it, obviously, on the PPCP side, as we continue to deliver Fastlane to that platform through many of our platform partners, it becomes easy for our small businesses to, one click, turn that on. So that will be a big part of our rollout. And then having good merchant conversations as well on the large enterprise side. And again, those are kicking off really in earnest this week at our C360 conference. 
 So again, the last thing I'd say just on pricing, and then, Jamie, see if you want to add anything, is because we've focused this year on a transition year, we may get very aggressive on the pricing side when it comes to Fastlane for 2024 because we want to drive adoption. 
 We think this is the best in the market innovation that all merchants should have access to. And as they think about winning this shopping season, our encouragement is improve the onboarding for them, create low-code, no-code opportunities for them to get up and running as fast as possible so that they can win this season and really prove to themselves that conversion improvement. And rest assured, we'll be pricing to value over time to ensure that we get the right value from that. 
 Jamie, anything you'd add? 
Jamie Miller: No, I think you've said it all. I really think Fastlane reinforces our holistic value prop, both for branded and for unbranded. And the focus on merchant checkout conversion, and that being at our core, I think, drives a strong value prop, and it will support strong pricing over time. 
James Chriss: The only thing that I would -- just last point is this conversion rate with Fastlane, what's so exciting to me is not just the 40% that's coming in, it's unrecognized users leveraging our brand and the 80% conversion rate of guest checkout for returning users. But this is just early days. This is with a handful of merchants. 
 This is a network effect. As we gain more and more users coming through, as these users now become returning users over and over again, those rates should continue to improve. And so this is already an order of magnitude better than anything else in the market. And with the network effect and scale that we have, we just expect it to continue to get better. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. 
Ramsey El-Assal: Alex, could you comment on the European Commission ruling to open up the iPhone NFC hardware on the handset, and whether you see that as a competitive opening for PayPal in Europe? I know there's some rumblings in the U.S. as well about that type of a move. I mean, how ready from a product perspective are you to take advantage of a more open NFC environment? 
James Chriss: Yes. Thank you for the question, Ramsey. So let me set the context so that it's clear how we think about it. First, we must play in an omnichannel world. We have established ourselves as the leader in the market in online. And our customers love us and use us globally for online checkout. 
 But they are demanding an off-line opportunity, an omnichannel opportunity, and to get the value that we're able to provide as we start to deliver not only the basics of our security and flexibility, but also as our rewards platform continues to improve, we want to be able to deliver a PayPal service for customers everywhere, anytime, every purchase. So we will be playing in an omnichannel environment. 
 That -- where there are locations where NFC opens up, that obviously becomes a very easy opportunity for us to provide a wallet in an Android or iPhone operating system, and we will be ready. If there are environments where it's not available, we will still operate in an omnichannel. 
 So omnichannel is a strategic initiative for us, it's something that is customer-backed and delivers an incredible PayPal experience, again, for every purchase and every checkout. And we'll take advantage of whatever market, whatever features and functionality we have in whatever market we play in. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. 
Jason Kupferberg: I just had a 2-part question. The first, just following up on the transaction profit dollar growth. I know you're now expecting slightly positive for the year. I guess that would seem to imply maybe a little bit of deceleration from the Q1 levels, even though the second half comps are a little easier. So just wanted to get a sense of whether that's conservatism or just some normalization of things like transaction and loan loss that helped you in Q1.
 And then the second part is just is there any change in your full year expectations for branded payment volume growth? 
Jamie Miller: So just to walk through a little bit of the first half, second half dynamics on transaction margin dollars. As I talked about before and you noted, I mean, Q1 in particular benefited from a few tailwinds. And we do expect those will be less meaningful as we move throughout the year. 
 First of all, the growth in our interest income on customer balances, it was the largest contributor. But when you start to look at later in the year, the comps just get more challenging. Rates are rising in the latter half of last year. 
 We also saw improvement in transaction loss and credit loss in the first quarter. Transaction loss in particular may not sustain -- or may not be as material as we move throughout the year. And we saw, as you pointed out, a meaningful benefit in loan losses in the first quarter, and we don't expect that to continue either. 
 So I'd say those few things are some of the dynamics. And then our initiatives and some of the new innovation that Alex talked about, it will take time to ramp. So right now, we're focused on execution. We want to keep expectations measured until we see really steady execution results. 
James Chriss: And just to underline Jamie's point, we have not put -- or we have put limited upside to this innovation that we've talked about in these expectations. And so again, this is about us having the flexibility, us ensuring that we take the right time and do the right thing by the customers as well as building the long term. But those are not built in to the rest of the year. 
Jamie Miller: Yes. And you asked about branded as well. And when we look at that, we had a nice quarter in terms of TPV and revenue. It was a healthy contributor to our transaction margin dollars. We did have some benefit this quarter from leap day. But by and large, we expect branded revenue trends to be pretty consistent with last year as we look at that. 
 And I guess the other comment I might make is that, when you think about take rate for us, we saw a decent drop last year. We do expect take rate will come down again this year, but not nearly to the same extent. And a little bit of that as it comes through on the branded trend line is just that we're seeing a little bit of mixing towards large enterprise from SMB. And that's impacting the take rate side. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. 
Michael Ng: Just 2 for me. First, I was just wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the drags on the smaller part of -- from the smaller part of the portfolio and transaction margin dollars. When does that kind of work itself out of the system? 
 And then related to transaction margin dollar growth, you talked about balance-funded Venmo transactions contributing to growth in the quarter. Could you expand a little bit on that? Do you see that scaling over the next couple of years? And what are the opportunities to improve card attach for Venmo users? 
Jamie Miller: Great. On the smaller parts of the portfolio, I guess what I'd say at a macro level, we had seen a pretty significant drag on that last year. It is coming through this year at a smaller rate. I mean, part of these are products we've deprecated. Some of these are, frankly, acquisitions that we just haven't invested in. And as Alex mentioned, we're going through a process of really looking hard at these. 
 Candidly, some are just in decline, but the declines are smaller. And some, we're investing in or making decisions to really put in more in maintenance mode, which is really shifting the profile going forward. But it will be smaller this year, and it will take a few years for that to burn off. 
James Chriss: Yes. Let me talk about -- up-level and talk about Venmo for a minute and the opportunity there. So again, on the positive side, we have the leading P2P platform with incredible customer base with disposable income 22% higher than the U.S. average, 60 million monthly active users and 90 million 12-month actives. So this is an incredible platform for us to work at. 
 As we talked about in previous calls, and I'll reiterate here, I'm dissatisfied in how we've really thought about monetizing the platform and really thought about delivering, in many ways, just customer experiences that they're looking for, right? Customers of Venmo are looking for dollars and looking for an alternative to traditional mechanisms when dollars are flowing in. And they want to be able to use Venmo for all of their expenses. 
 Just to give you -- put some numbers behind it. There's $18 billion of net new funds that flow into the platform of Venmo every single month. 80% of those dollars leave within 10 days. That is just unacceptable. 
 And so our ability to provide the products and services that our customers need when those dollars come in, whether that's improving debit card penetration, which you've heard as a focus, and you've heard we already, in some of our onboarding flows, are starting to make significant improvements on; or providing other opportunities for money in or money out opportunities and access to capital for our Venmo users. This is just a clear opportunity and a clear focus area for us. 
 So again, early days. The team is focused on it. Hopefully, you hear sort of a reinvigoration in my voice of what Venmo can be and the opportunity ahead of us. But very, very excited about where we're taking it. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. 
Bryan Keane: Solid first quarter results here. My question is just still more on the big picture. The naysayers on PayPal would say the company is structurally challenged with the rise of payment methods like Apple Pay. Alex, I know you've been at PayPal now for a little over 6 months. What do you think the naysayers are missing on the competitive advantages PayPal still has in the market? In particular to grow branded? 
James Chriss: Thank you, Bryan. Thanks for the question. So a couple of thoughts here that I think people are maybe not appreciating enough. The first is 60% of the market is still what I would consider to be nonconsumption. 60% of the market still does not use any mark. So that's what we're playing for. 
 We have the best brand. We have the best products and services and the best ability to be able to deliver. And with products like Fastlane not only delivering a reboarding opportunity for our customers, but that stat that I put in earlier, around 40% of unrecognized customers coming through and taking a Fastlane experience, now gives us an opportunity to be able to remarket to them and turn them into PayPal customers. 
 So step one, 60% of the market is nonconsumption, and I think we've got a leading opportunity there. On the other 40%, we're still the leading player. And to be, again, transparent and I've said this before, we have not delivered the innovation and the experience that I would expect and that our customers expect. 
 We are doing that now. Improvement in the app, an improvement in the branded experience, reducing latency by 50%. Investing in passwordless opportunities and passkeys will improve the conversion rate and improve the experience. And then creating value-added opportunities and an increased value proposition for our consumers with rewards. I think we're the only player out there at the scale that we have to provide that end-to-end experience. 
 And again, we provide everything for our customers. It's rewards. It's Buy Now, Pay Later. It's the debit experience. And back to what I mentioned earlier on the call, with an omnichannel play now, PayPal can be the solution that you can use anytime, anywhere. 
 So our ability to now start to play in an offline world and take the same brand and the same experience to every purchase, I think, is something that, again, gets me excited. But we've got to prove it, and we've got to continue to execute and create great experiences in the market for our customers. 
Bryan Keane: That's great. And just had one follow-up. We are getting a few questions on the pending CFPB regulation on late fees. Any impact on PayPal from CFPB caps on late fees? 
Jamie Miller: So first, while PayPal is not directly impacted by that regulation, we are indirectly impacted through our revenue share with our consumer credit partner. There's a lot of uncertainty right now around both timing and implementation of that. And as I mentioned before, our guide excludes the impact of that, just given the uncertainty. 
 The industry expects that, if implemented, the impact would be largely offset over time. And we have been very focused on mitigation. We have actions underway. In -- but really, in any scenario, it takes time for those offsets to fully set in. But I guess what I'd say in terms of impact is the date that's being debated right now is the May 14 implementation date. And if that were to be implemented, it would be approximately a 3 percentage point impact to EPS growth for the year, but that is before mitigation. So by 2025, we would expect roughly half of that impact to be offset, and then more over time. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. 
James Faucette: Wanted to go back to Fastlane. And Alex, you made the comments around making Fastlane available to all merchants and deriving -- so that they can derive the benefits of it. How should we think about that in terms of what needs to be done, timeline for progression, et cetera? It sounds like you're going to start moving beyond at least those initial merchants that are using it now. But just trying to think about like how that ultimately could end up with most of the first -- the merchants served by Braintree, and then ultimately, the merchants served by PayPal more broadly. 
James Chriss: Yes. Thanks, James. Here's the best way to think about it. First and foremost, we have to have the best innovation in the market. We -- it was important for us to get some early customers up and running and using it. And the data continues to hold and certainly delight these merchants. 
 And look, in this world, they all talk to each other. And so the ability for our merchants to now be rabid fans of the checkout conversion improvement that they're seeing through Fastlane is great proof points for us as we now start to scale it, and again, think about price to value. 
 The second leg will be, okay, now that we've proven this out and we've started to really -- I mean, just to be clear, we're talking about driving conversion rate for some of the largest merchants in the world. We need to make sure that this was proven and that it works before we roll this out at scale. There's a lot on the line to be able to nail this, which is why we're moving at a measured pace and ensuring that, in Q1 and Q2, we've really proven it out. 
 The conversations we're having at our C360 conference right now, the conversations we're having with some of our PPCP platforms that are now rolling it out to small businesses, is okay, what is the way that, as we get to the second half of the year, we can really enable the merchants to have this up and running so that they can win the shopping season, holiday season in the back half of the year? 
 So that's how we're thinking about it. Merchant demand is very encouraging. As you would imagine, when you have a product that improves conversion rate and provides a double-digit lift in guest checkout conversion, that's a game-changer. And so demand is high. We want to make sure that we have as low friction and onboarding experience as possible, which is why we wanted to make sure that the ability for folks to upgrade to new integrations would make sense and be easy for them. And we wanted to make sure that customers could onboard. 
 So the plan is, back half of the year, get as many merchants on so that they can win the holiday season. This will still take time. Not everyone will get on for this holiday season, and we expect that will continue into 2025. 
 But at some point, there will be a tipping point. If I think about over the next year or 2 years, where we are going to expect all of our merchants to be on the latest and greatest integration, which includes Fastlane. And we will then move to deprecate our old integrations. And that's going to be an important milestone for us as we take what is really 15 years of legacy integrations and consolidate them on a more modern stack and a more modern integration for our customers. That allows us to continue to build innovation, continue to drive the best experiences for merchants, for customers, and obviously the best transaction margin results for the company as well. 
James Faucette: That's great. Appreciate the color there, Alex. And then you mentioned you're getting a little bit of improvement in Venmo transaction margin. How much of that is coming from increased acceptance of Venmo as a payment option versus finding ways to reduce costs in transacting Venmo and P2P transactions, et cetera? Just trying to understand kind of what the drivers there are and what the potential could be. 
James Chriss: Yes. It is a combination. What I'd say is we're seeing Pay with Venmo really starting to take off. Obviously, it's -- in the U.S., it's an incredibly well-loved brand. And when people see that button, it's an opportunity for them to use those dollars that I mentioned earlier that are in their account. So that's an exciting piece online. 
 The piece that, again, I'm sort of dissatisfied with but excited about the future is the offline piece, right? When I talk about omnichannel, it's for PayPal and for Venmo. And so those billions of dollars that are coming in every month into the Venmo ecosystem, we have to continue to give our customers opportunities, whether it's debit card penetration or other innovation that we come up, with for them to be able to tap and pay and check out. And so all of that will move towards improving transaction margin. 
 That said, we're also getting better with our risk models and leveraging AI. We are -- there's a lot of AI conversations in the market. I would say we are one of the leaders when it comes to leveraging the data that we have at scale to improve our transaction losses, improve the customer service ability for our customers and improve our transaction margin over time. 
 So still, again, early days. There's a lot of work to continue there. But again, my excitement for the path and the direction for Venmo is pretty high. 
Operator: That is all the time we have for questions. I will turn the call back to Alex Chriss for closing remarks. 
James Chriss: Fantastic. Thank you, Sarah. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As you can tell from our results and the comments today, we're making steady progress on our transformation efforts. We had a good first quarter, and we are deep in execution mode. And with time, we will return this company to profitable growth that I know we can deliver. So thank you all.

2024,Q2,2024-07-30,"Operator: Good morning and welcome to PayPal's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sarah and I'll be your conference operator today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, PayPal's Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.
Steve Winoker : Thanks, Sarah. Welcome to PayPal's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I'm joined by President and CEO, Alex Chriss and CFO, Jamie Miller. Our remarks today include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from these statements. Our commentary is based on our best view of the world and our businesses, as we see them today. As described in our earnings press release, SEC filings and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes. Now over to you, Alex.
Alex Chriss : Thank you, Steve. And thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. PayPal delivered a strong second quarter and first half with encouraging operating and financial results. While change takes time and we still have much work ahead of us, we are well positioned today, have the right leadership in place, and are moving full steam ahead. I'm confident we are on the right track in making meaningful progress on our transformation to position PayPal for long-term, durable and profitable growth. Looking at our results in the second quarter, total payment volume rose 11% to $417 billion, and we delivered 9% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis. Transaction margin dollars grew 8%, representing our best performance on that metric since 2021. Our non-GAAP earnings per share increased 36% year-over-year. We're encouraged to see not only the strength and stability in PayPal's platform, but also early contributions from some of the initiatives we have underway. Branded checkout continues to grow profitably. Braintree is now meaningfully contributing to transaction margin dollar growth for the first time in over two years. Venmo momentum continues to build and monthly active accounts increased across both PayPal and Venmo. Given the strength across PayPal, we are raising our full year guidance for growth in transaction margin dollars and earnings per share, and increasing our investment in strategic growth initiatives that we are driving. Overall, we remain on course with the strategy we set at the beginning of the year. Our teams are moving with urgency, excited about our innovation, and focused on execution. We are still early in our transformation, and while pleased with our progress in many areas, we know there is much more we can do and with greater speed. For example, mobile experiences, SMB, and Venmo are places we are working hard to improve, and we are continuing to identify ways to operate more effectively and efficiently. I want to spend a moment discussing how PayPal stands apart, as a strategic commerce partner. In the past two quarters, we have talked at length about the experience upgrades we are bringing to branded checkout. However, I do not want to lose sight of what makes PayPal truly differentiated, our two-sided network of hundreds of millions of consumers and merchants worldwide. We are building an end-to-end platform, spanning the full commerce journey with superior customer experiences and sales conversion from start to finish. PayPal is one of the only players with both sides of the network, consumer and merchant at scale globally and with the infrastructure to support it. That is incredibly hard to replicate and a powerful foundation on which to launch new innovations including Fastlane and the Ads platform that we are in the early stages of building. The data insights and compounding network effects, give us an incredible advantage that we are now just beginning to harness fully. Today, we operate in a massive $6 trillion plus global e-commerce market that benefits from the ongoing digitization of payments and commerce in new contexts. These tailwinds, combined with the initiatives we are now executing, such as building more omnichannel capabilities and offering more value-added services for consumers and merchants, will expand our addressable market and provide PayPal with significant opportunity for long-term growth. Over the last year, we've been working to transform our global business from a series of products and services into a multi-faceted, omni-channel, and open platform capable of generating value in multiple ways throughout the commerce ecosystem. We are building a platform that delivers far more value to our customers and partners than the individual products we offer. This is a key differentiator for PayPal and will expand our market opportunity over time. The initial response to the innovations we are introducing gives us confidence that we will see more consumers and more engagement in more places across our growing network. That in turn will drive more merchants and higher levels of commitment into our ecosystem. These network effects will be mutually reinforcing, compounding, and add value to the company. Our peers are taking note, and the value of our platform is being recognized by large tech companies that are seeking to partner with us in a variety of new ways. One great example of this is Meta, which we already partner with on multiple fronts. PayPal is a top payment method for advertisers and consumers globally across Meta's family of apps. Meta's donations and charitable giving campaigns now run on the PayPal Giving Fund platform. Meta pays out creators and developers using Hyperwallet, and Meta uses Braintree for credit card processing. We are working closely with Meta to optimize the experiences and look forward to deepening our partnership with Meta in mutually beneficial ways in the months and years ahead. You will continue to hear about more partnerships with deepening commitments over the coming quarters. Let me update you on our customer-backed business strategies. We continue to execute with high velocity to enhance customer experiences and value for our large enterprises, SMBs, and consumers. We are building the foundation for our next phase of growth. For large enterprises, we continue to have a productive conversation to help merchants understand the additional value they can unlock by strengthening their relationship with us to take advantage of our full platform capabilities. For example, we recently renewed our contract with DoorDash to expand how we work together. Beyond unbranded PSP processing and offering our branded marks, DoorDash also relies on our risk capabilities to mitigate losses. As part of our new agreement, DoorDash has committed as an initial launch partner for our latest branded checkout enhancements that we announced in January. And they will be participating in our new ads platform. Combining our best-in-class payments platform with value-added services that are margin accretive is helping us create a more profitable dynamic. Last quarter, I told you we expected to make Fastlane generally available in the US, in the second half of the year. I'm pleased to announce that in August, we are delivering on that commitment and making Fastlane generally available to merchants in the US. This includes merchants on Braintree and PPCP, as well as through partners, including Salesforce, Adobe, and BigCommerce. While broad adoption will take time, we have heard from many merchants who are excited to add Fastlane and have a robust go-to-market strategy. As I've shared before, data from our early adopters shows that returning Fastlane users, convert at nearly 80% versus the industry average guest checkout conversion closer to 50%. As our network builds with more merchants and consumers, we expect benefits to scale over time because we will be able to recognize even more shoppers. The early feedback we've heard from our merchants and sales team gives us increasing confidence that Fastlane will accelerate PayPal's ability to capture the roughly 60% share of e-commerce purchases made without a branded mark. As a reminder, A large part of that 60% is still manual card entry, has low conversion today, and is generally a poor experience for consumers and merchants. Much of that is now changing with Fastlane. For small and medium-sized businesses, we are continuing to improve our value proposition through the rollout of PPCP. We continue to make progress migrating volume from legacy platforms onto this new solution, as well as integrating with new partners and merchants. SMB volume on PPCP continues to trend positively, up more than 40% through the first half of the year. A large portion of that volume is coming from merchants using PayPal as their full stack processor across both branded and unbranded payments. Our efforts here are also important because PPCP ensures merchants have our latest branded checkout integration, which will include Fastlane. That will give consumers a best-in-class checkout experience wherever they shop and help merchants benefit from higher conversion. On average, merchants who adopt PPCP use more products, which deepens our relationship, reduces churn, and drives higher average revenue per account. As I said before, this is an area where we are focused, and we have tremendous opportunity to better serve small businesses' end-to-end needs. For consumers, we are focused on extending our leadership in consumer preference, increasing the share of checkout, and driving more frequent engagement from our consumers. In the second quarter, we launched in-app offers with major brands including Best Buy, Priceline, Lyft, Instacart, Ticketmaster, Walmart, and Nordstrom. We are seeing positive trends in consumer engagement with gross merchandise volume driven by one of our offers nearly tripling in June compared to March. And while still early days, the initial interest from advertisers is encouraging. As we shared before, you will see us invest in marketing in the back half of the year and beyond to further position PayPal and Venmo as rewarding ways to pay. I talked previously about our need to improve our branded checkout experiences on mobile devices. That improvement is now happening. In the first half, we started ramping several designs and technology innovations to our branded checkout flows to improve the experience for our customers. For example, we are launching a new super simple vaulted experience for high repeat use merchants. In initial tests, the redesigned vaulting payment page alone shows a conversion lift of 75 to 110 basis points. Experiences like this one are clearly resonating with consumers. And remember that every point of conversion lift, drives significant value for our merchants who are fighting to win every sale. We will be ramping our redesigned branded checkout experiences to all eligible consumers in the US in the coming weeks and months. As the number one branded mark with the largest network of merchant acceptance, we are a ubiquitous checkout solution. We are continuing to innovate and create high converting experiences on both desktop and mobile and across platforms and devices. We also continue engaging consumers post purchase with smart receipts, package tracking, push notifications, and more, adding increased value and driving the PayPal engagement flywheel. In fact, we drove almost 20 million app logins from our post-purchase experiences in June alone, growing more than 70% from a year ago. P2P is an essential acquisition and engagement tool for us, and we are returning it to growth. We suffered declines through 2023, but over the past few quarters we have seen an improvement driven by product enhancements such as new global withdrawal capabilities, better risk decisioning, and more cross-border activity. We will continue to invest in our experiences, pricing, and marketing to drive enhanced awareness and engagement. Turning to Venmo, we are building on the business’s strong market position. In the second quarter, Venmo processed more than $73 billion in total payment volume, growing 8% year-over-year. With monthly active, increasing 5% year-over-year, to nearly 62 million. Both a strong base of peer-to-peer users and adoption of our ecosystem of products are driving this growth. For example, both Venmo debit card and Pay with Venmo monthly actives grew approximately 30%. In the second quarter, we launched push provisioning of the Venmo debit card to Apple and Google wallets and continued to enable Pay with Venmo with more merchants and partners, including eBay and StubHub, which we expect will continue to fuel this growth. Our recently launched Venmo Teen Accounts is showing encouraging early traction, expanding our addressable market, and helping us build lifelong relationships with customers from an early age. What excites me most about Venmo is that we are only scratching the surface of its potential, starting to drive customer-led, profitable innovation, and we see substantial headroom for growth. Said simply, Venmo is primed for growth. Finally, consumers who love PayPal for online purchases are also telling merchants they want to use PayPal for their offline purchases. We continue to drive the adoption of our card products, and we're making it easier to add PayPal and Venmo branded cards to Apple and Google wallets on mobile devices. We are also looking forward to launching even more ways for consumers to use PayPal anytime, anyplace with NFC technology starting in Europe. Expect to see more from us in the coming quarters to enable and incentivize our customers to use PayPal online and in person. Reflecting on the quarter and looking ahead, I want to thank the PayPal team for continuing to work tirelessly as we transform our company and give our customers the best possible experiences. With that, over to Jamie.
Jamie Miller : Thanks Alex. Good morning everyone. Moving to Slide 6, PayPal delivered strong second quarter results and we are raising our full year guidance. We're passing through the first half performance and increasing second half growth investments as we build confidence in initiatives across the company. Our goal for 2024 remains the same, to set PayPal up for long-term success by prioritizing investments that will deliver durable, profitable growth. As Alex mentioned, while the second quarter produced another improving set of results, change takes time and can sometimes be uneven. The success of our transformation will be measured over quarters and years. We have a lot of work ahead but the teams are making progress and building on a strong foundation visible in our first half results. Looking at the high-level financial results in the second quarter, revenue increased 8% at spot and 9% on a currency-neutral basis. Transaction margin dollars grew 8% year-over-year, a more than 300 basis point improvement from the first quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.19, representing 36% year-over-year growth. And relative to our prior expectations, higher earnings per share were driven by a combination of factors, including stronger transaction margin dollar growth and interest income. Turning to Slide 7, our financial results are a function of the number of customers we have, how engaged they are across our platform, and how frequently they transact with us. Our operating metrics reflect progress on this front. We ended the second quarter with 429 million total active accounts and 222 million monthly active accounts. Total active accounts increased by nearly 2 million from the first quarter and included growth in PayPal merchant and consumer accounts in addition to other products. We were encouraged to see sustained total active account growth following a positive inflection in the first quarter. Monthly active accounts continued to show steady progress, up 3% year-over-year to $222 million with contributions from both PayPal consumer accounts and Venmo. Transactions per active account, which is a trailing 12-month number with 60.9 in the second quarter up 11%. Excluding PSP processing, which is primarily Braintree, transactions per active account grew 6%. Moving to Slide 8, total payment volume grew 11% on a spot and currency-neutral basis to $417 billion. US TPV grew 11%. International TPV also grew 11% on a currency neutral basis, primarily driven by strength in continental Europe and Asia. Looking at the breakdown by product, global branded checkout volumes grew 6% on a currency neutral basis in the second quarter. This was consistent with our first quarter performance, which increased 6%, excluding a one-point benefit from the additional leap day. Within branded checkout, we continue to see strength across large enterprise platforms, marketplaces, and international growth. We remain laser-focused on driving deeper adoption of our best-in-class solutions with small and medium businesses and improving our mobile experiences, which are critical, particularly in markets like the US. And the UK PSP processing volume grew 19% in the quarter compared to 26% in the first quarter. Importantly, we are beginning to see the benefit of our shift in strategy to drive profitable growth. Our focus on price to value is having an impact with Braintree now contributing positively to transaction margin dollar growth in a meaningful way. Moving to more financial detail on slide 9, transaction revenue grew 9% on a spot basis to $7.2 billion driven primarily by Braintree, Branded Checkout, and Venmo. Other value-added services revenue in the quarter was close to flat at $732 million. Interest on customer balances continued to be a meaningful tailwind to OVAS revenue and contributed approximately 3 points to transaction margin dollar growth in the quarter. Revenue within our credit business declined year-over-year but performed in-line with expectations. Part of the decline is due to proactive decisions made last year to manage risk and reduce on-balance sheet merchant receivables. We are also seeing ongoing normalization of loss rates within our off-balance sheet US Consumer revolving portfolio. Overall, we have taken steps over the last year to actively manage the credit portfolio's exposure and are continuing to position the portfolio to move toward a less capital-intensive business model. Transaction take rate declined by 3 basis points to 1.72% compared to a 5 basis point decline last quarter. PSP Volumes and Venmo benefited transaction take rate, which was offset by faster large enterprise growth within our branded checkout business, foreign exchange fees, and an acceleration in other merchant services, including payouts. Transaction margin dollars increased 8% in the second quarter compared to a 4% increase in the first quarter. Higher interest on customer balances, branded checkout, Braintree, and Venmo were the largest contributors to year-over-year growth. Branded checkout and Venmo's strong transaction margin results benefited from ongoing efforts to improve and optimize transaction loss performance as well as some transaction expense favorability. While it's still early, we are encouraged to see initial actions related to price value, as well as product and ongoing risk enhancements make a positive impact. Relative to last quarter, we saw Braintree return to profitable growth and improvements in the contribution from Venmo, Branded Checkout, and P2P. Non-transaction-related operating expenses declined 1% as we continue to actively manage our cost structure, while reinvesting in key growth initiatives. Non-GAAP operating income grew 24% in the quarter to $1.5 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 18.5% benefiting from expense leverage and improvement in transaction margin trends. PayPal generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter, and we completed $1.5 billion in share repurchases, bringing share repurchases over the past 12 months to approximately $5 billion. Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of more than $18 billion and debt of just over $12 billion. Moving to guidance on Slide 10 for the third quarter and the full year in 2024, for the remainder of the year, we continue to guide, assuming a relatively consistent macroeconomic and consumer spending environment. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to grow by mid-single digits and non-GAAP EPS to grow by high single digits. We are raising our guidance for the full year and now expect 2024 non-GAAP EPS to grow in the low to mid-teens. This increase reflects outperformance in the second quarter, as well as a slightly more positive view of the second half of the year, with some strategic reinvestment into growth initiatives. Underpinning our guidance, we now expect transaction margin dollars to increase by a low to mid-single digit percentage for the full year. We have seen steady profitable growth from our branded checkout business and feel confident in the progress our teams are making. It is encouraging to see the initial impact of our initiatives related to price to value, as well as ongoing product enhancements in areas like P2P. Some of our efforts, particularly on the innovation side, are still early and will take time to scale. But we are encouraged by the initial results and customer response, as we begin moving from the test and pilot phases into launch. As we move into the second half of the year, we expect to continue to make progress on these fronts, but there are a few factors to keep in mind. Consistent with the strategy we laid out in prior quarters, our teams continue to prioritize high-quality, profitable growth as we execute against our long-term roadmap. Related to this, we expect lower volume and revenue growth as we move through the second half of the year. This is deliberate, and it shows good progress. By strategically focusing on price-to-value in areas like large enterprise processing within Braintree, we are driving transaction margin dollar improvements even on a lower volume growth. Offsetting some of these improvements, we expect a much smaller tailwind from growth and interest on customer balances, which represented an approximately 3 percentage point tailwind to transaction margin dollar growth in the first half. We were also planning prudently and forecasting less favorability with some normalization in transaction and credit losses. We continue to expect non-transaction operating expenses to increase slightly with ongoing efficiency funding our strategic growth investments. Our investment spending will ramp as the year progresses to support our highest priority growth initiatives that go-to-market of new products, partnerships, and innovation, as well as reinvigorated marketing and brand campaigns for both PayPal and Venmo. These investments are all in support of re-accelerating durable, profitable growth for the company. Given the strong start to the year, we are raising our 2024 free cashflow guidance to approximately $6 billion. We are also increasing our share buyback plan to $6 billion compared to our prior guidance for at least $5 billion. In closing, we've been making good progress throughout the first half of 2024, as we drive significant change across the company. We have clear opportunities to lean in further and ensure we stay on offense in what remains a competitive and dynamic environment. We're excited about the path forward and look forward to updating you on our progress along the way. With that, back to you, Alex.
Alex Chriss : Thank you, Jamie. To summarize, PayPal grew profitably again with strength in multiple areas, including branded, unbranded, and Venmo. We are also starting to see traction in several initiatives. Taken together, these results highlight the strength of PayPal's global commerce platform. I'll leave you with one last example. You've heard me talk about our Venmo customers, looking for us to provide more money in and money out opportunities. As we are improving opportunities to spend Venmo balance with products like Venmo debit card or pay with Venmo, we are seeing a corresponding improvement in funds being used within the Venmo ecosystem rather than transferred out. This is an example of meeting our customers where they are, solving their needs, and driving monetization and margin improvement in the process. Overall, this was a strong quarter for PayPal, and it gives us the confidence to both increase our growth investments and raise our full year profit and free cash flow guide. I'm proud of our team and excited about the coming quarters and years for PayPal. Steve, let's go to Q&A.
Steve Winoker : Thanks Alex. Before we open the line, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask just one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Sarah, please open the line.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.
Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question and great to see all the progress that you're making. Branded volumes maintain the X-leap year growth rate from last quarter. Can you drill down a bit more into your strategy to drive branded growth acceleration? You mentioned it focused on mobile vaulting user interface. What are the most important levers? And then maybe also, did Jamie's comments on lower volume right there at the end of the prepared remarks in the second half apply to both branded and unbranded volumes? Thanks.
Alex Chriss: Yeah, thanks for the question, Ramsey. You know, we're excited to see the progress that we've made on branded. As you can see, we've got a consistent, loyal customer base that continues to use and love PayPal. What we've been focused on over the last six months is really some of the things I've touched on before, the experiences particularly around mobile. I touched on some of it in the comments, but the teams are working night and day now to improve everything from the vaulted experience, which is essential on mobile. This is think of high usage, high repeat usage checkout experience where you actually vault PayPal as your default. We've now improved that experience. And as I mentioned, we're seeing a 75 to 110 basis point lift with our new experience. We're also rolling out a new pay sheet experience overall, which simplifies, gives customers still the choice of whether they're using PayPal Balance or any instrument they want, as well as buy-now, pay-later, but just simplifying the experience. And We are seeing a nice lift in conversion rate there as well. So big focus on the end-to-end customer experience. We feel like that combined with the ubiquity that we have just in marks across both mobile and web gives us the ability to continue to not only maintain, but where we want to be, which is taking share in the branded experience.
Jamie Miller: Great. And Ramsey, on the second part of your question about lower volumes in the second half, that primarily relates to Braintree. We are seeing both lapping of larger wins this year, particularly in the second half, and some shifting and normalization in the Braintree revenue profile, just as we enter into and really get into the process of working with our customers around our mission around profitable growth. But on the branded checkout side of things, we expect the second half to be consistent with the first. July is off to a good start. What we've seen in July is very consistent with the first half so far. So we feel pretty good about that.
Ramsey El-Assal: Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Darren Peller with Wolf Research. Your line is open.
Darrin Peller: Hey, guys. Thanks, and nice results, especially on the transaction margin side. So I'll just start there and touch on the dynamics around what's contributing to it from mix versus you talked a lot about pricing per value, which we've heard more and more about in the industry also, so it's good to see, but maybe more direction and color on the contributing forces. And adding onto that, the sustainability of the strength you saw this quarter in growing transaction margin dollars at these rates. Help us understand your expectations there going forward now. Obviously, you updated guidance, but really beyond just the next few months. Thanks, guys.
Jamie Miller: Yeah, so good morning, Darrin. Thank you. So maybe I'll start with the biggest contributors to transaction margin dollar growth and talk a little bit about the second half there as well. So we were really excited to see the broad base strengths and the acceleration. There's a lot the team has underway and there's several significant contributors to the growth. First, we talked about in my prepared remarks, interest income on customer balances. That was about 3 points in the first half. But second, and really very strong was branded checkout. It continues to grow profitably as a healthy contributor to transaction margin dollar growth. Braintree, which you mentioned, it is back to contributing to transaction margin dollar growth, which we're really excited about. And it's really great to see some progress from our shift in focus there. Venmo continues to benefit not only from the strong consumer, but, you know, we're doing a nice job in Venmo too, driving continued growth in monthly actives. And then lastly, transaction loss favorability continued to be favorable in the second quarter as well, which was nice to see. When we think about the second half, there is really a couple of things to think about there. I'd say first is that our first half tailwinds around interest income, you know, will begin to decline. We've just got higher comps in the second half of 2023, as rates were coming up in the second half of last year. So that impact on transaction margin dollar growth, the percentage, that'll start to come down. The second is that we saw transaction loss favorability in both the first quarter and the second quarter. It is feeling more durable than we expected, even in the first quarter. Having said that, we're planning for some normalization in the second half. As we get better in transaction loss prevention and detection. So do bad actors, and they continue to work hard to do different things. And the second is we are launching a number of products in the second half. And any time you launch products, we're just being prudent around how we think about transaction loss to make sure that if we have a few bugs in the process, we're working the kinks out as we go. But the core business is solid. We are more positive than we were three months ago on Braintree profitability, P2P, on transaction loss. It's still early in our progress but we're driving significant change.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Tien-Tsin Huang: Hi, thanks. Good results here. I wanted to ask about the second half growth and investments. It looks like in your guidance you're applying a fourth quarter step down in EPS performance there. So does that, should we assume that that's heavy marketing around the holiday? Can you maybe just give a little bit more specifics on what you're marketing exactly and what kind of return you're expecting? Thanks.
Jamie Miller: Hi, Tien-Tsin. Good morning. I'll take the first part, and then maybe Alex will want to comment on the marketing pieces of it. So in the first half, we've done, I think, a really nice job with expense discipline. We've taken a number of actions to reduce our OpEx profile, while at the same time remixing or prioritizing investment back into engineering product and some marketing. Now we intentionally deferred in the first half some marketing dollars to the second half. So when you look at the second half profile, you're seeing the same underlying core reinvestment in engineering and go-to-market and things like that. But you're also seeing a much bigger ramp in our marketing spend, you know, around marketing and brand campaigns for both PayPal and Venmo. But really also around these product launches, really making sure we put our marketing dollars to work to have that hit the ground running the way we need to. So in the second half, when you think about the EPS guide side of it, more than half of that 4Q pressure is the ramping of those growth investments. The other side, I'll just mention this quickly while around the topic, is that we've got a higher tax rate in the second half than we have in the first half. And so that, particularly on a comparative basis to last year, is what's impacting some of the EPS profile?
Alex Chriss: Yeah, and just to pile on and dig a little bit deeper, you know, this is very deliberate. The first half of the year, we needed to invest in innovation and invest in the customer experiences and put to market experiences on both PayPal and Venmo from a consumer standpoint that we can be proud of. I feel like we are at that place now. The experience on the PayPal app, what we are putting out on branded experiences, and even just the engagements, just the new designs, the shopping and rewards that now exist inside of the PayPal app is completely rebuilt and new. On the Venmo side, you've seen the improvement as we started to create real onboarding ramps for our debit card, and we are seeing the improvement there. So feeling really good about the experiences on both of the apps and it's time to tell the world about it. And we are excited to ramp up some of our go-to-market spend in sort of exciting and engaging ways.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Harshita Rawat: Hi, good morning. Alex, I want to ask about Europe. Historically PayPal has grown in the region despite not investing enough. How are you thinking about Europe among PayPal's international markets? Looks like the company has a very strong local presence and the regulatory environment is now more favorable with respect to NFC access [iPhone] (ph)? Thank you.
Alex Chriss: Yeah, I think it's a great question, and it's one of the things that we may overlook sometimes when we just think about PayPal. We are a global company, and the way customers use us, whether it be cross-border, whether it be access to merchants all over the world, is truly a global phenomenon. We've invested heavily over the years in ensuring that we are compliant in everywhere that we want to be in over 200 different markets. You know, as we think about our strategy, as I've laid out in the past, to make sure that PayPal is available everywhere for every purchase every time. That includes being able to be available in an omnichannel solution, whether it's e-commerce or whether it's in-person. And with some of the changes coming particularly in Europe around NFC, that opens up the opportunity for us and we will be prepared shortly to be able to play in that space. So it's exciting to see our growth. I'll hit one more example. Our buy now pay later growth that we continue to see, 60% of that volume comes from outside of the US. So we are bringing the entire ecosystem of what PayPal brings to the global stage and excited to continue to invest there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is open.
Colin Sebastian: Great, thanks, and good morning to everybody. I was curious on the SMB initiatives, in particular the strategy to drive more adoption of branded checkouts, how important Fastlane is that initiative. And then also, if you think advertising can be ultimately a lever for that side of the business as well on both sides of the network. Thank you.
Alex Chriss: Yeah, it's a great question. And SMB, as I've said since I got here, I think is an untapped opportunity for us. So let's just pull back and talk about what SMBs really need. Small businesses are there fighting for every customer. They need to be able to find customers, they need to be able to engage with customers, convert them, and then reengage with them. And really what they're looking for is an end-to-end platform and an end-to-end solution to help them. It is very difficult for a small business to piece together 17 different solutions. They just don't have the bandwidth, the people, and the time to be able to make that happen. With PPCP, we now have put together the most powerful single platform for them to be able to run their business in a full stack manner. So with PPCP, you now get branded experiences with the best branded experiences. You get access to the best guest checkout conversion with Fastlane. You get unbranded processing so that you can ensure that you can process anywhere around the world. You get every mark. You get buy-now pay-later. You get access to our working capital. And then as you mentioned, now that we start to roll out our ads platform, you get the ability to drive new customers. You also get the ability to re-engage with customers in a delightful way, so package tracking, smart receipts, the ability to be able to re-market to customers even after they've purchased. All of this is in one place with one partner. And so, you know, we're in early days right now. PPCP really is just rolling out. We're excited about the progress and the growth, but there's a lot more to play here. Live in 30 markets and through 40 partner channels. But I think we're just getting started. This is going to play out over the next few years.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.
Sanjay Sakhrani: Good morning. It's nice to hear about the accelerated general availability of Fastlane. Maybe you could talk about what it means from a revenue contribution standpoint. And if not this year, maybe we could just talk about how we should think about the revenue contribution. Would it be through more engagement? And then maybe just secondly, if you could just talk about the volume trends. It seemed like US was pretty stable, international dropped off. Maybe you could fill a bit more color there would be helpful. Thanks.
Alex Chriss: Yeah, let me start with Fastlane. So just as a reminder for everyone, Fastlane is really tackling the 60% of checkout that is guest checkout. We've got a unique experience because of the volume of our two-sided network and the consumers that we see coming in, where we're able to dramatically change the conversion rate for repeat users. So 80% conversion rate versus a traditional roughly 50% on a repeat user. Our goal is to capture and help all merchants for all guest checkouts. So the way we built Fastlane is this really is a platform that can be processed or agnostic. And we want to be able to help every consumer come through and have a delightful guest checkout experience. As well as enable actually our ability to capture them through a Fastlane by PayPal experience and bring them into a branded experience as well. So there's a flywheel effect. In terms of rollout, we're rolling this out now. We've got a developer day situated in a few weeks from this time in August. We're going GA now in August as well, and so we'll be ramping up as many customers as we can. We've not talked about and disclosed pricing on this, so I'm not going to get into that at this point. But know that this is our ability to monetize not just guest checkout that we process through Braintree but really for us the total addressable market is the entire guest checkout experience across the board.
Jamie Miller: Yeah and on the second part of your question around the US and international environments, you know as I mentioned before we see the US environment being very consistent right now with what we've seen over the first half. International is a real strength for us and we did have a shift, down a bit in the international area on TPV this quarter, but when you look at that, what that really is, it's almost solely related to lapping some large Braintree [wins] (ph) last year, otherwise very healthy.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is open.
Dan Dolev: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thank you for letting me ask the question. Great results. I wanted to ask you, Alex a little bit about the competitive positioning regarding Apple Pay. Obviously, really strong branded checkout. There has been some worries in the past. Can you maybe contextualize a little bit where we are and you know what you're doing to beat them? Thank you.
Alex Chriss: Yeah thanks Dan, great question. So let me set some context. So first we play in a massive multi-trillion dollar market and it's not a zero-sum game. So we expect competitors, we've had competitors come in since we launched, you know, over a decade ago. We went from one button to now there's lots of different buttons and branded experiences and we'll expect that to continue. Let me, though, set the context of the reality of today, and then how we think about the future. So the reality today, we are the Number #1 branded experience across all platforms and devices. If we narrow down into desktop web, which is still 40% to 50% of all checkout, we see no degradation in our share over the past four years. So let me say that again. We've held share despite competition. Second, if we look across browsers, there's actually no difference in our selection rate across different browsers. So certain buttons moving from one platform to the other just isn't material to us. So that's where we are today. So let us focus around our ability to continue to improve and make this a better experience for our consumers going forward. So for merchants, they're looking for an end-to-end solution. They want to get customers, they want to convert customers, and they want to engage and have a return experience with customers. As we talked about, we now have the best branded experience. We're continuing to improve that. We have Fastlane, we have the best checkout experience. And we've rolled out ads and continuing to invest in our profiles. So we are helping merchants end-to-end. On a consumer side, they're looking for ubiquity, flexibility, and a rewarding experience. We are the most ubiquitous. We have 80% acceptance rate in the developed world with a large and growing customer base. And from a flexibility standpoint, they want to be able to pay everywhere with any way that they can -- that they want to pay and we're able to provide that. So if you pull back, I'm just excited that we are in a strong position of being the most complete platform and two-sided global network, driving the highest value and benefit to our consumers and our merchants.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo with UBS Financial. Your line is open.
Timothy Chiodo: Great. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I wanted to drill into, branded checkout a little bit with the 6% growth. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the relative levels of growth, US versus International. Branded, you did call out the strength and international with continental Europe and Asia. And then also on the relative levels of transaction margin, given that there are some differences in transaction expense levels and also potentially merchant size mix. Would appreciate those. Thanks.
Jamie Miller: Yeah, so on a relative level of growth, US and international, both continue to be strong contributors for us. There's obviously different market mixes and different [merchant] (ph) mixes, as you look at those growth profiles. You know, in the US, large enterprises continue to be an area of strength for us. And I would say, in the small business area, we continue to remix that portfolio as we move to PPCP and off of legacy platforms and really move to both a direct and a partner strategy there. You know, when you look at the international side of things, branded checkout is very, very strong in several European, both countries and corridors. UK continues to be pressured, but I would say outside of that, we've got real strength in other countries such as Germany and just real bright spots in Europe as well. So I'd say it is fairly balanced across the globe when you look at it. I'm trying to look at the second part of your question here. Transaction expense. You know, when you look at transaction expense, it is impacted by funding mix, product mix, geo mix, all of that stuff. Funding mix relatively stable. The biggest driver of our shift in TE right now is been Braintree, and that continues to be what is happening there. We're always looking at ways to continuously improve our transaction expense profile and work with different partners to move the needle on that. And we continue to have different benefits, different quarters just in terms of how that rolls-through, none of which was particularly material, but we had a little bit of that too.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Jason Kupferberg: Good morning guys, thanks. I just wanted to ask a follow-up question on the full year guide for the transaction profit dollar growth. Obviously you're ticking that up here. It does imply the deceleration in the second half that you mentioned around flow comps, et cetera. What I'm trying to get a sense of, has your full year outlook for transaction profit dollar growth from the core branded and Braintree businesses changed, just to kind of isolate the delta here in the guidance?
Jamie Miller: Yeah, I would say generally we are seeing a stronger branded baseline and we're having increasing confidence in the slope of our Braintree profitability efforts. That's what I would say on those two.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
James Faucette: Great, thank you so much. Want to circle back to Fastlane and obviously a lot of interest and excitement in terms of its launch timing, et cetera. And I think you've made it pretty clear that this will be kind of a gradual opportunity that will build on it and addressing a big market. How should we think about, like, what your key to-dos are as we go through the rest of this year and into next year? And I'm wondering if any of Fastlane with the launch timing is now built into the guidance, as well as any other new initiatives that may have been added into guidance for the rest of the year. Thanks.
Alex Chriss: Yeah, let me start with the last part. We really not built any Fastlane upside into guidance. And part of that is because of our go-to-market is going to be very focused on just getting adoption, not around monetizing in this half of the year. Now, to be clear, we are pricing in the contracts that we're signing with customers, and so pricing is built in and as I said before, the TAM is every guest checkout. That's what our focus is. But it's not built into the second half of the year. In terms of key to-dos, we really created and worked hard during this beta period to create a seamless experience so that developers and merchants can get on board as fast as possible. And so, you know, for someone using us now, it is really a four to four week experience to get onto the Fastlane code and enable that to roll out. So we need to get it on as many platforms as we can, so that small businesses in particular can just one click a button and turn it on for the holidays. We are working with many of our large enterprises who want access to this before the holidays as well. But again, look, the reality is we've got a lot of merchants around the world, and it is going to take time for them to be able to put this into their roadmap. So that's why we want to set expectations that this is going to take quarters and years to get everyone on board. But the beauty of Fastlane is it's a network effect. More customers coming through it, we are already seeing best-in-class conversion rates. The more customers that come through it, the more profiles that we start to capture, and the better the conversion rates should become. So we want to get started as fast as possible, get as many merchants through this holiday season as we can, and then build from there.
Steve Winoker: Sarah, let's make time for one last question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi. Your line is open.
Andrew Schmidt: Hey Alex and Jamie. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to double-click just on the Braintree trends. Obviously, good progress in terms of transaction margin dollar growth. Maybe you could talk a little bit more about what's driving that, clearly more disciplined, lapping of large contracts? And then as we look to the back half and beyond, I hear you on the slope that's kind of built into the outlook. But from what you've seen so far, how does it inform your confidence in terms of building on the progress that you've seen so far in transaction margin dollar growth as we go into the back half in the subsequent years? Thanks a lot.
Jamie Miller: So, good morning Andrew. Thank you. So first well, let's just talk through the Braintree growth and what's really driving that. We set out this year to really reorient the team with Braintree around profitable growth. And as we've done that -- we've had just a number of conversations with customers, both around contract renewal, but also just around our holistic relationship and really getting into understanding how we partner, what the margin structure is, how we provide value-added services, just the overall value-to-value exchange that we have got. And honestly, they've been really positive conversations as we -- and just on a total relationship basis sort of thing. As we looked at that, there are certain situations where as we've gotten into the discussion, we are willing to accept a lower share of revenue in exchange for a higher margin contract. There is other situations where, as we work with our customers, we are able to sell in value-added services in ways that we just haven't done before. So it is lots of different levers in that process. But what we are excited about is we are really starting to see good traction on that. It is intentional. We've set out to do this. And it is a really good thing for the business. And I think as you look at the second half, what we saw play out in the second quarter, I expect to continue. We saw some of the volume growth normalize a bit, but we saw more positive transaction margin dollar growth. And it is really good to see that tangible progress play out. And I think it will continue to play out over time. It may be a little bit uneven and not linear, but that trend of a little bit more normalization into the business, but improving margin profiles is something we fully expect to continue.
Steve Winoker: Alex, I think you have time for any final comments you might have?
Jamie Miller: Yes. Thank you all today, and thanks Steve. Just to close the call, company is energized. We are proud of what we've accomplished, just to again, sort of step -- set the context of where we are. We are really six months in. We've got a new leadership team. We are getting stronger every day. We've returned the company to transaction margin growth. We've returned the company to a consumer user growth. We significantly improved profitability at Braintree, and we are accelerating Venmo. And so I just feel really proud that we are stronger today than we were six months ago, and we will be stronger six months from now than we are today. And we are executing against our game plan. This will be measured in quarters and years. So it will be a long game, but six months in, we are on the right trajectory. So thank you all for today and see you next quarter.

2024,Q3,2024-10-29,"Operator: Good morning, and welcome to PayPal's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sarah, and I will be your conference operator today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, PayPal's Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.
Steve Winoker: Thanks, Sarah. Welcome to PayPal's third quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm joined by CEO, Alex Chriss; and CFO, Jamie Miller. Our remarks today include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from these statements. Our commentary is based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our earnings press release, SEC filings and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes. Now over to you, Alex.
Alex Chriss: Thanks, Steve, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. PayPal had a highly productive third quarter. We made good progress on our continued transformation, while delivering strong operating and financial results. We brought multiple innovations to market, coupled with a significant new marketing campaign and are seeing encouraging early adoption. And we continue to forge important partnerships with leaders in global commerce. We are early in our transformation journey, and we have a lot of work ahead to get to where we want to be. However, I'm proud of what we've been able to achieve in the last year, and it gives me conviction that we're taking the necessary steps to unlock the full potential of PayPal and Venmo over time. We've assembled a world-class leadership team, reignited innovation for our customers and are now moving with clear purpose and increased velocity. We're leaning into our competitive advantage, a two-sided network of hundreds of millions of consumers and tens of millions of merchants around the world to evolve from a set of disparate payment products and point solutions into a powerful commerce platform. As we shift from a payments company to a commerce platform, more of the world's leading commerce players have partnered with us to add value for our mutual customers. In just over two months, we've announced partnerships with Fiserv, Adyen, Amazon, Global Payments and Shopify, and we're actively discussing more collaborations across the industry. These new and expanded relationships are a clear demonstration that our brand, innovations and momentum are resonating. Before we discuss this quarter's details, I'm excited to announce that we will host an Investor Day on February 25 in New York City. We look forward to seeing many of you in person in sharing our team's longer-term strategy, key opportunities, financial and operating targets and how we will get there. Now turning to our Q3 results. Total payment volume grew 9% to $423 billion. We delivered $7.8 billion in revenue, growing 6% on a currency neutral basis. Transaction margin dollars grew 8% to $3.7 billion and were up 6%, excluding the benefit of interest on customer balances. Our non-GAAP earnings per share increased 22% year-over-year. Importantly, this translated into significant free cash flow. We're proud of these results and have a clear plan to drive continued profitable growth over the long-term. After another strong quarter, we're raising our full year guidance for transaction margin dollars and non-GAAP earnings per share. At the same time, we're continuing to invest in areas that we believe will drive long-term profitable growth. Let me update you on our customer business strategies and the promising early results we're seeing. When I joined, it was clear that we had significant work to do to improve branded checkout. PayPal had fallen behind on innovation, and we had work to do to be more competitive, particularly on mobile devices. In January, we shared new mobile checkout experiences designed to significantly improve conversion. We've completed testing over the past few quarters and are now rolling out to customers new experiences on both desktop and mobile. These new checkout experiences are second to none. When implemented properly, the new product experiences are resulting on average in more than 100 basis points of conversion lift for vaulted checkout and up to 400 basis points of conversion uplift for one-time checkout. We're also seeing a 15% to 20% increase in Buy Now, Pay Later use. These experiences are live on close to 5% of our U.S. checkout traffic today, and we're pushing hard to get them into the hands of more of our merchants throughout the holiday shopping season and into next year. I'm proud of our team's innovation velocity as we reestablish ourselves as the best converting branded experience for consumers and merchants. Continuing in large enterprise. We're making solid progress on our initiative to price our services in a way that reflects the current value we bring to our merchants. This is now the second consecutive quarter in more than two years, that Braintree is meaningfully contributing to transaction margin dollar growth. We're having very constructive conversations with our merchants, focused on ways we can enable strategic growth opportunities that drive long-term upside for both of us. What is different today is that we now have a suite of value added services, including payouts, risk as a service, orchestration, guest checkout and personalization capabilities that help attract new customers and convert them more effectively, in addition to world-class payment processing. We're excited about our progress here as it is key to long-term value creation. Finally, we're pleased with the initial reaction to Fastlane, which targets the 60% of e-commerce purchases made without a branded mark. Since we launched in August, we have over 1,000 merchants using Fastlane to provide a seamless experience to their customers and drive increased conversion. We've also reached a new milestone in our ability to recognize and auto fill information for first-time Fastlane users. In the U.S., 170 million eligible customer profiles on the PayPal platform can now enjoy a seamless guest checkout, the very first time they try Fastlane. The scale of consumers who are primed to spend with PayPal puts us way ahead of other guest checkout solutions, and it is one of the reasons why so many platforms are choosing to partner with us. We can't wait to get Fastlane into the hands of more merchants, not only on Braintree and PPCP, but also through our partnerships with Fiserv, Adyen and Global Payments next year. Moving to small and medium-sized businesses. Last month, we launched PayPal Complete Payments in new geographies, including China and Hong Kong with more market on the horizon in 2025. In the markets where PPCP is live, we're steadily converting volume from our legacy products with nearly 40% of our SMB processing and checkout volume now on this platform. What is important to remember is that many of these merchants are using PayPal for both branded and unbranded payments, an example of the benefits that come with integrated solutions. PayPal Complete Payments also allows us to work with many small and medium-sized businesses through partner platforms, including Shopify. As we announced in the quarter, PayPal is now an additional processor for Shopify Payments in the U.S. Our branded checkout solutions are now integrated into Shopify Payments, creating a single, unified experience for time constrained business owners to drive operational efficiency. We also recently announced a partnership with Amazon to bring PayPal Checkout to SMBs offering Buy with Prime. Next year, we will expand our work together to give Prime members the option to link their Amazon and PayPal accounts so that consumers can receive Prime shipping benefits when they use PayPal, while shopping with Buy with Prime. While they will take time to realize, there is significant opportunity here and more we can do to better serve the needs of small businesses. For consumers, we're redefining our value proposition with last month's launch of PayPal Everywhere. This initiative builds on PayPal's established brand position as an online shopping powerhouse to position PayPal as the go-to solution for spending, sending and earning rewards whether online or offline. We're doing this through cashback incentives on the PayPal debit card, a marketing campaign with the goal of reintroducing our capabilities to consumers, who may never have thought about PayPal as more than an online payment option. We're starting to shift perceptions of PayPal and beginning to drive adoption of our suite of complementary products, which all drive back to branded checkout. The broader awareness and perception shift we're aiming for is not going to happen overnight. This is an area where we plan to continue to invest over time. That said, we're seeing early signs that give us confidence our strategy is working. Since we launched PayPal Everywhere, we've added more than 1 million first-time debit card users. As a reminder, we're allowing consumers to pick a cashback category of their choice each month, which is capped at $50 per month. The top three categories, customers are choosing and earning rewards for us so far are groceries, gas and restaurants. What gets me so excited is that we're now seeing customers make daily in-person purchases with their PayPal debit card. In addition, these debit card users are now choosing PayPal branded checkout more frequently when they shop online. Early data from our existing customers shows a 5x increase in total omni spend within the first two weeks of sign-up. We plan to expand the PayPal Everywhere value proposition to Europe next year, incorporating learnings from our U.S. launch. We expect the availability of NFC capabilities will help drive further adoption and use of PayPal. With Venmo, we're making progress in executing our strategy to shift from solely a P2P service to a central part of consumers' financial lives. Our new leadership team is taking a fresh look at Venmo, and we're completely transforming and upgrading the user experience. We know that we inherited one of the strongest P2P brands and see an opportunity to prioritize innovations that unlock Venmo's value. We believe that Venmo will eventually have multiple monetization levers. In the short-term, we see two meaningful contributors. Let me unpack each of them. First is the Venmo debit card, which allows customers to spend with their balance, both online and offline. We're in the early days of driving adoption, but we're seeing encouraging trends in engagement and monetization. In the quarter, monthly active debit card accounts grew 30% yet again. This is exciting as the average revenue per account is 4 times that of all Venmo accounts. However, only 5% of Venmo active accounts are monthly active Venmo debit card users demonstrating the opportunity ahead of us. The second lever is Pay with Venmo, which provides a seamless way to pay online. The strategy with Pay with Venmo involves both consumer and merchant adoption. On the consumer side, 8% of Venmo active accounts are monthly active Pay with Venmo users, so we have room to grow. Monthly active Pay with Venmo users were up 20% in the quarter, and the average revenue per account is 3 times that of all Venmo accounts. On the merchant side, we will bundle Pay with Venmo with PayPal Checkout in our go-to-market motions to accelerate distribution. With these product improvements in place, we're now leaning into marketing for Venmo for the first-time in years. We will continue to build on this foundation and obsess over consumer needs and our product to fully unlock the brand's long-term potential as a multibillion dollar franchise. I want to thank the PayPal team for their continued commitment to transforming our company and making it even stronger. We've got the right team in place and we're playing to win. With that, over to Jamie.
Jamie Miller: Thanks, Alex. Moving to Slide 7. PayPal delivered another strong quarter of results. The underlying stability and consistency of the business is encouraging, and we remain focused on advancing our transformation to drive durable, profitable growth. Change takes time, and we still have a lot of work ahead, but the team is making steady progress on top of an already solid foundation. Looking at the high level financial results in the quarter, revenue increased 6% on both a spot and currency neutral basis. Transaction margin dollars accelerated slightly from the second quarter, in addition to a nearly 3 point benefit from interest on customer balances, branded checkout, Venmo, Braintree, and better transaction loss performance contributed to growth in the quarter. Our focus on price to value is paying off with Braintree again contributing materially to transaction margin dollars even as volume and revenue growth deliberately slows. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.20, representing 22% year-over-year growth. Relative to our guidance, outperformance was driven by a number of factors, including continued optimization of transaction loss, Venmo and improvements in credit. Turning to Slide 8. Our operating metrics reflect another quarter of progress. Total active accounts increased by nearly 3 million from the second quarter to 432 million. Monthly active accounts continued to show steady progress, up 2% year-over-year to 223 million with contributions from PayPal consumer accounts and Venmo. Transactions per active account, which is a trailing 12 month number were 61.4 in the third quarter, up 9%. Excluding PSP processing, transactions per active grew 5%. Moving to Slide 9. Total payment volume grew 9% on a spot and currency neutral basis to $423 billion. Looking at the breakdown by product, global branded checkout volumes grew 6% on a currency neutral basis in the third quarter, consistent with the mid-single digit growth we've seen for the last three years. Within branded checkout, we continue to see strength across large enterprise platforms, marketplaces and international merchants. As Alex mentioned, our team is hard at work to drive wider coverage of our most modern best-in-class checkout experiences. We are particularly focused on small and medium businesses and mobile, both critically important areas for us to improve our positioning. PSP processing volume grew 11% compared to 19% in the second quarter. As part of our price-to-value strategy, we are moving deliberately and making decisions that prioritize healthy, profitable growth rather than targeting a high proportion of processing volume at low or even negative margins. What this looks like in practice with some of our largest enterprise customers is often a renegotiated agreement that reduces our total share of payment processing to a more balanced level. So for example, from 95% to 75%, but with better economics and with a greater breadth of products and services. This means we are driving Braintree transaction margin dollar improvements and more strategic partnerships, but with lower volume and revenue growth. Moving to more financial detail on Slide 10. Transaction revenue grew 6% on a spot basis to $7.1 billion, driven primarily by Braintree, branded checkout and Venmo. Other value added services revenue in the quarter increased 2% to $780 million, and interest on customer balances continued to be a meaningful tailwind to OVAS and credit revenue was under less pressure compared to the past three quarters. We have now fully lapped the actions taken last year to tighten credit underwriting and reduce on balance sheet risk. We're seeing better performance across the portfolio and have now started to modestly grow merchant originations. We'll continue to prudently manage the portfolio's exposure with the goal of sustaining our balance sheet light business model, while providing our customers with more ways to manage their cash flow, spending and borrowing needs. Transaction take rate declined by 4 basis points to 1.67% compared to a 3 basis point decline last quarter. Improvements in Braintree and Venmo monetization benefited transaction take rate. These were offset by large enterprise and marketplace growth within branded checkout, foreign exchange and faster payouts growth. Turning to transaction margin dollar growth. As I said earlier, interest on customer balances, branded checkout, Venmo and Braintree were the largest contributors. Results in the quarter continue to benefit from efforts to optimize transaction loss performance with more advanced data analytics and some transaction expense favorability. Non-transaction related operating expenses increased 3% as we continue to actively manage our cost structure while reinvesting in key growth initiatives, including marketing that was deferred from the first half of the year and the rollout of new products and initiatives like PayPal Everywhere. Non-GAAP operating income grew 18% in the quarter to $1.5 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 194 basis points to 18.8%, benefiting from transaction margin expansion as well as expense leverage. PayPal generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow in the third quarter. We completed $1.8 billion in share repurchases, bringing the total number of share repurchases over the past 12 months to approximately $5.4 billion. Finally, we ended the quarter with $16.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments and $12.4 billion in debt. Moving to guidance on Slide 11 for the fourth quarter and the full year 2024. We continue to assume a relatively consistent macroeconomic and consumer spending environment for the remainder of the year. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to grow by a low-single digit percentage. This is directly related to Braintree merchant negotiations and ongoing efforts to drive quality, profitable growth. As I mentioned earlier, this is a deliberate action and a continuation of the strategy we've articulated throughout the year, where we have accepted a lower near-term Braintree revenue profile in exchange for better margins as we have renegotiated agreements. As a result of these efforts, we expect lower Braintree volume and revenue growth in the fourth quarter and through 2025 before reaccelerating from the reset baseline. This is a healthy profitable trade-off for the business that benefits transaction margin dollar growth and build stronger, more strategic relationships. We expect higher non-transaction OpEx growth in the fourth quarter as we have intentionally concentrated more of our discretionary investment spend, particularly in marketing during the back half of the year and in the holiday season. This is strategically timed to support key initiatives, including the go-to-market of new products and innovation, as well as ongoing marketing and brand campaigns for PayPal and Venmo. Due to this timing, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS to decrease by a low to mid-single digit percentage. 2024's full year non-transaction OpEx growth rate, which we now expect to increase in the low-single digit range is a reasonable way to think about the OpEx profile for the business next year. But like this year, we expect some unevenness in any given quarter. Moving to the full year in more detail. We are raising our guidance for transaction margin dollars and non-GAAP earnings per share. This increase reflects outperformance in the third quarter as well as strategic reinvestments back into growth initiatives. We now expect 2024 non-GAAP EPS to grow in the high-teens and full year transaction margin dollars to increase by a mid-single digit percentage. We have seen steady profitable growth from our branded checkout business, and the teams are advancing our checkout initiatives. I'm encouraged by the rollout of innovation, the initial impact of our price-to-value strategy, ongoing product enhancements in areas like Venmo and P2P and the customer response to the launch of PayPal Everywhere. As we move into the fourth quarter and beyond, we expect to continue making progress, but there are a few factors to keep in mind. Through the first three quarters of the year, growth in interest on customer balances and improvements to transaction loss were an approximately 4 point percentage benefit to transaction margin dollars. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we expect minimal benefit from growth and interest on customer balances and then a headwind beginning in 2025 due to interest rate cuts. We're also planning for some normalization and transaction losses as we roll out new products. We now expect full year non-transaction operating expenses to increase in the low-single digit range with ongoing cost efficiency helping to fund our strategic growth investments. As we move into next year, our focus will be on striking the right balance between investment and productivity, seeking to largely fund long-term investments through savings generated from better deployment of tech and automation. We continue to expect 2024 free cash flow of approximately $6 billion and continue to plan for $6 billion of share buyback this year. In closing, I'd like to thank the PayPal team for their ongoing dedication as we drive meaningful change to strengthen our foundation for profitable growth. We are continuing to execute and we're making good progress and we're excited to share more with you at our Investor Day in February. With that, back to you, Alex.
Alex Chriss: Today, I am more confident than ever about our future. We have a durable and differentiated market position and a strong brand that we continue to aggressively invest in. PayPal has a massive global opportunity. We have the right team in place to harness that opportunity and we are firing on all cylinders. It's an enviable position, and we're ready to make the most of it to drive value for our customers and shareholders, as we head into the holiday season and 2025. Overall, this was a good quarter for PayPal. We are confident in our strategy and ability to execute going into the holiday season and 2025. Steve, let's go to Q&A.
Steve Winoker: Open the line, I ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask just one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Sarah, please open the line.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Darrin Peller: Hey, guys. Thanks and nice results on gross profit in the quarter. Look, unbranded decelerated as expected. It looks like you've been able to successfully meet that with strong pricing for value. So maybe, Alex, if you could just start by touching on the customer response to the pricing changes and what you're bringing to the table? And then just maybe perhaps touch on the deceleration, again, embedded in fourth quarter margin growth along with how we should think about the exit rate into '25. Jamie, that was helpful color, but any more just in terms of the dynamics and what gives you conviction in the sustainability to the underlying trends? Thanks, guys.
Jamie Miller: Why don't I start with the second part of your question, Darrin. Good morning. And then Alex can talk about merchant response. So when we look at transaction margin dollars, as you mentioned, we're really excited about our momentum throughout 2024. And maybe I'll pause and just talk for a second about third quarter transaction margin and then talk about the comparative to fourth quarter. And what's important here is, we did have benefit from interest income in the third quarter. It was about 3 points. But more importantly, we have really good underlying growth drivers. Branded checkout TPV was up 6%, profitably growing transaction margin. It was our second quarter with Braintree contributing nicely to transaction margin dollars growth. So just continued progress there, which has been great. And then Venmo monetization, and Alex mentioned a couple of the data points on the call that, that's really starting to move along. And it's early days, but we're starting to see that become very consistent as it rolls through transaction margin dollars. So all of that consistent trends into fourth quarter. But what we've see in fourth quarter that is a little bit different is that, number one, interest income, it's been a benefit all year, that is going to be a meaningfully lower tailwind in fourth quarter. I'm planning on less than 1 point of contribution to transaction margin dollar growth in the fourth quarter. So really relatively immaterial. And then we're also planning for transaction loss normalization as well. We're launching new products, and we also have some lower fraud recoveries just on a comparative basis. So if I pull up for fourth quarter, we're really looking at low to mid-single digit transaction margin dollar growth for the fourth quarter. Quarter's off to a good start. But the most important holiday weeks are ahead of us, but the consumer feels strong at this point. And then if I pull to '25, I think the thing to think about is, when we look at '25, ex-interest income, we expect transaction margin dollars to grow at least as fast as 2024 on that same basis.
Alex Chriss: Great. Thanks, Jamie. And Darrin, just to hit on the merchant response. I've personally been involved in a number of these conversations and I'd characterize them as very healthy and very strategic. As Jamie described in her remarks, a lot of this is, us really laying out our strategy to be focused on profitable revenue growth. And sometimes that comes with a relook at our contracts and a relook at the partnership, but I’d say we're bringing more to the table now. And so the conversations we're having with these merchants is, we're innovating, we're bringing Fastlane, we're bringing ads platform. We're bringing additional value-added services that allow us to have a healthier, stronger conversation about where we're going. So it's not that all the merchants were excited to have the conversations, but they understand where we're coming from and we're bringing more to the table. And again, I feel like, as we’ve talked about, we are really focused on building durable growth levers and making sure that we have these conversations with merchants and getting back into a healthy place is a big part of that conversation.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Tien-Tsin Huang: Hi. Thanks so much. Appreciate all this -- all the data points here. Can you just give us a little bit more detail on the drivers of the more favorable view on transaction margin dollar growth here for the fourth quarter? And would love to hear what might improve and what you're most excited about going into 2025. And I recognize that it's hard to completely offset some of the interest income, but just curious what to be -- what we should be looking here for acceleration in '25? Thank you.
Jamie Miller: Tien-Tsin, good morning. I really think it gets back to the key themes that we've been seeing all year. We've really focused on durable, profitable growth as we've set the teams up for this year. And part of that gets back to the product innovation and the deep investments we're making in our consumer experience and working with our merchants around branded checkout. The trends on branded have been very consistent throughout this year. And second, and this dovetails with what Alex was just talking about, the focus of the teams around how to really have our Braintree platform be more holistic, really looking at the holistic margin profile and really getting that to a place where we've got a much deeper breadth of value-added services with merchants. I mean, all of those things are things that again, have been growing this year, but the momentum we're seeing now and the visibility into how that continues is just, we just have more confidence and we're more constructive on that today than we were three months ago. And then, Venmo and even P2P, the PayPal peer-to-peer money transfer, those two products are really turning nicely for us. P2P has had a nice turn this year, and we're continuing to see good momentum. And then, when we look at Venmo, the actions of the team to really broaden how we bring this product to our consumers is really real and really rich. And you hear it in some of the data points Alex shared in his prepared remarks. But when you actually look at kind of the activity roll through, Venmo's just a very consistently sticky product for us. So really excited about that. And that's what I see as fourth quarter just continuation and then moving into '25 as well.
Alex Chriss: Yeah. Just -- Tien-Tsin, just to reinforce what Jamie just talked about, what we talked about with contracts on Braintree, I think that's pretty clear. Venmo, you heard in my remarks, the core drivers that we have, we've now implemented from an innovation perspective. Our Pay with Venmo continued rollout. Our debit card is now embedded in the product. So I feel very good about the durable growth there. Maybe something we haven't connected the dots on well enough is, all of the innovation that we're doing with Fastlane and with PayPal Everywhere and with what I talked about in my remarks on branded checkout, it all comes back to that durable branded checkout growth, right? PayPal Everywhere, we're starting to see real habituation of people not just getting access to the offline checkout, but also now bringing that back into online. So all of this is driving back branded checkout growth. Same with Fastlane, where we're now starting to get more and more users that are just used to seeing the PayPal experience, and we can now market to them to bring them back. So as we move into 2025, I feel like, we are very focused on the core drivers that are important to the business, and we are innovating in the places that matter for our customers and will drive continued durable profitable transaction margin dollar growth into '25 and beyond.
Jamie Miller: Yeah. And maybe, Tien-Tsin, I want to come back and just talk a little bit about interest rates because you mentioned that in your question. And I think, it's probably helpful to table set on that a little bit. So we've talked about transaction margin dollar growth at 8%. When you look at transaction margin dollar growth ex-interest income, which is really a metric we look at just as much as we do the main metric because we think it really represents what we're doing operationally in the business, that measure has been 4% year-to-date this year compared to negative the last couple of years. So when we look at that, really very excited about what we're seeing there. But when we level up and talk about rates, we've had that 3 point benefit this year, fourth quarter. I expect that benefit to be relatively immaterial. The rate cuts that are assumed in the forward curve, let's just pause for a minute on that, our portfolio is about a four month duration. So it just takes time, and it will take time for any particular rate cut to flow through. But the way to think about it when you’re thinking about ‘25 is a 25 basis point rate cut is equivalent to about $40 million of transaction margin. And it depends on timing and when that happens. But if you just said, okay, we’re going to take it down by 100 basis points to 150 basis points next year, it’s about a 1 to 2 point drag on transaction margin dollar growth. So running the business ex-interest income is something we’re going to be very, very focused on, as we go forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.
Ramsey El-Assal: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question this morning. Now that you have a larger sample size of Fastlane acceptance in the marketplace, can you update us on the monetization strategy? Help us think through how potentially additive Fastlane take rates might be versus average unbranded volume yields?
Alex Chriss: Yeah. Let me take the rollout of Fastlane and then, Jamie, if you want to pile on with anything. We are seeing great uptake in Fastlane. I mentioned over 1,000 merchants. We also, as you've seen are starting to bring on additional processors as part of that platform as well. And really, that is the focus of the innovation right now is improving the conversion rate in the 60% of non-consumption of a branded mark. So the majority of checkout is still guest checkout. We now have the best converting guest checkout product in the market. And so, our focus right now is adoption. Our focus is ensuring we get as many processors up and running. That's important, particularly, as we start to bring large enterprises into Fastlane as well because many of them are multiprocessor and will need potentially a Braintree and an Adyen Fastlane experience as well. And so right now, again, all of our focus on Fastlane is adoption. Pricing is built in to all of our contracts. We have relationships directly with the merchants. But our focus right now has been on adoption, and we'll continue to drive that up.
Jamie Miller: Yeah. And with respect to economics and how this will flow through, we are in the midst of a lot of conversations with merchants. And all of that includes the pricing element. And we’ve got good arrangements with our partners as well. Clearly, Fastlane will take time to ramp. And as we get through fourth quarter and through 2025, it will take time to ramp and see in the numbers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Jason Kupferberg: Thanks, guys. Good morning. I wanted to ask about branded TPV growth. I'm assuming you're expecting continued stability at around 6% in Q4. I'm just wondering, if the broader rollout of the new checkout experience will accelerate the branded growth in 2025? And just as part of that, I know you gave the metric that 5% of U.S. checkout traffic is on the new experience. Any sense of where that potentially goes over the next 12 months? Thanks.
Alex Chriss: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Jason. So to the first part of your question, yes, we see consistent trends when it comes to branded checkout. Again, our focus, and I've been consistent with this really for a year now is the improvement in our branded checkout experience. I've been very transparent that we had fallen behind on innovation, particularly on mobile. And as I sit here today, I am really proud and excited with the experiences we are now putting into market. And I shared some of the data on the improvement in one-time checkout with the 400 basis point improvement in conversion. Vaulted checkout, 100 basis point improvement in conversion. So we've also reduced latency in the overall experience by 45%. We've included additional mobile specific innovations like an app switch, which is driving 10% lift and success for -- versus just password, which is driving -- it's over 97% success rate on iOS now. So overall, we have rebuilt the entire pay sheet, the entire experience on mobile. I expect us to continue to improve on branded checkout. This is a core focus for the business, not only these experiences, but as I mentioned earlier, Fastlane and PayPal Everywhere, everything driving continued flywheel back into branded checkout. So all-in-all, we need to see this play out. In terms of the ramp, I mentioned we're 5% now. Look, the way I think about it is there are some integrations we have with merchants. Think about it as roughly a third or so, of our integrations, we are in -- we have some ability to continue to ramp up. We will do that throughout the holiday season and into early next year. And then some we need, as we've talked about before, many, many -- hundreds of different integration patterns that we need merchants to do the work on. And so the good news is, they now have an incentive to do it. The conversion improvements are significant. And the conversations with merchants now are very healthy, and they’re excited about getting these new experiences ramped up once they get past the holidays. So we’re not standing still. I expect continued momentum on that 5% throughout the next quarter and into 2025.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is open.
Dan Dolev: Hey, guys. Amazing results again. I wanted to ask, if it wasn't addressed already. Are you able to give us like a sneak preview of how you see '25 because from our conversations, this remains a big debate? So I appreciate it. Thank you.
Jamie Miller: Good morning, Dan. I think some of the comments that we've talked about already really helps shape '25 to a degree. You start with the revenue line. When we looked at some of the very deliberate and intentional conversations we've had with Braintree merchants, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're seeing the impact of some of the revenue trades we're making begin to flow through the numbers in the third quarter. And that's also implicit in our fourth quarter guide as well. We expect that trend to continue through 2025 as we really shift from focusing on high portions of revenue to just more holistic, better margin contracts. Transaction margin, we've talked about a little bit that ex-interest income, really expect to see at least as favorable in 2024. One area we really haven't talked about is OpEx. And if I spend a minute on that, we do expect to see a higher proportion of OpEx in the fourth quarter than we've seen all year. And we're really reinvesting favorability back into the business. And in addition to that, we had deferred marketing expenses very deliberately from the first half into the second half. So you see that pop-up in the fourth quarter. We now expect the full year to be up low-single digits from an OpEx perspective. And when you look at 2025, that's probably the right framing and way to think about it as well. But just more balanced throughout the year in terms of how it flows through.
Alex Chriss: Let me just -- I'd love to just share and unpack because you asked a little sneak peek about how we think about it and how we talk about it in the business. We are hyper focused on what we are in control of, and we are focused on building durable growth levers. It's why the focus of the innovations that we've talked about, whether it's branded checkout, everything coming back to that, whether it's the conversations in getting healthier Braintree economics, rolling out new innovations like Fastlane and PayPal Everywhere. All of these are things we're in all of its innovation that is important to our customers and that we can monetize over the long term. We also, from the metrics that we're focused on really are thinking about transaction margin dollar excluding interest income because that's the metric we can really think about and be in control of. And again, as Jamie said, if you think about the last two years, that was a negative amount for us. We've now turned that positive in 2024. I believe we now have built a solid foundation and baseline for us to grow on. And I expect 2025 to grow on top of that. So we, at least as strong and grow from where we set the baseline in '24. So the team is focused. Our innovations will continue to roll out into the market, and I think we're in a healthy place.
Steve Winoker: And that’s part of the good thing, Dan, also about the Investor Day that we announced, that Alex announced today in late February, where we’ll have the chance to also dive more deeply into all those elements.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Chiodo with UBS. Your line is open.
Timothy Chiodo: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I want to hit on Braintree, two aspects there. One around competitive positioning on pricing now with the new sort of rebased pricing strategy. And then, also the ability to bundle and get prominent positioning with the button. So first on the pricing piece, really stated its (ph) -- with this new strategy, would you still consider Braintree to be more of a price leader, meaning when the contract is reset, is Braintree still the lowest price of all the merchant acquirers working with these various large enterprise merchants? And the second piece is, in the past, the button was often bundled as part of the contracts to receive prominent position on websites. Is that clause still able to be added into those contracts with this new pricing strategy?
Alex Chriss: Yeah. It's a great question, Tim. Here's the way I think about it. We are not -- we are changing the conversation with our merchants. It is not just about a processing what I would consider, in some cases, to be just a commodity conversation about pricing. We are -- when we talk about price to value, we're talking about the full strategic conversation and what we bring to the table. And what -- so when I talk about the healthy conversations we're having, and again, I'm having many of these myself. When I talk to the CEO of a merchant, yes, they want great processing pricing. But what they're really focused on, how do they grow customers? How do they get more customers to buy their products? And those are now value services that we're able to bring to them, not just best-in-class processing, not just FX as a service, risk as a service, the ability to sell all around the world. But now we're bringing to them an ads platform. Now we're bringing to them the ability to start to target with payment APIs, the right customers at the right time. And these are really fun and really healthy conversations. And so, yeah, to be honest, yes, we will bundle branded because that's important to us. And it's important to them because it's still the best converting branded checkout option in the world. Yes. We will still have significant pricing that we will price to value, and we will continue to price all our value-added services. What's most important is, these are now bigger, more strategic conversations with merchants that actually help them drive the growth of their business, not just processing their payments.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
James Faucette: Thanks very much. Really appreciate, Alex, your comments there on changing the conversation and being able to bring incremental value, including ad platform and driving that. I guess following up on Tim's question there, as you think about that, as you change that conversation, how should we be thinking about the potential then for pricing or value add and that kind of thing in the future? I know that you've -- I think you've done a really good job outlining that this is going to take time during the course of '25, but thinking about the long-term trajectory of where you would ultimately like to get and what you think that value looks like? Thanks.
Alex Chriss: Yeah. I think, again, it's very similar to what I just shared, which is, for us having these more strategic, deeper relationships that we can monetize across all of our value-added services is what's most important. And so again, whether it's processing, which, again, we should monetize or all the value-added services or the ad platform, Fastlane, all of these different pieces, we're going to continue to lean in. And we're going to continue to work with our partners to drive branded checkout as well, right? One of the things that's interesting as we have these strategic conversations is, how excited these merchants are about the demographics that we have as we start to reignite PayPal Everywhere, right? There's opportunities with merchants that are omnichannel merchants that are thinking about, hey, how can PayPal Everywhere now work in the store as well? As we start to bring Pay with Venmo. Pay with Venmo is an incredible opportunity for merchants as they now think about the ability to get access to one of the most valuable demographics of young, affluent spenders in the United States. And so again, all of these conversations just continue to build on themselves. And I think, we feel good about the conversations as well. Jamie?
Jamie Miller: Yeah. Maybe I'd just add too, a little bit about where we are in the process. We have worked our way through some large renegotiations, which have been really good conversations. But we've got more progress as well in the next couple of years. The agreements are typically multiyear in nature. Some renewals happen earlier than others. But we expect that more visible impact on TPV and revenue over the next several quarters. But more importantly, we expect margin accretion to emerge over the next few years as well and part of that is these renegotiations. But equally, importantly, and you mentioned value-added services, it puts us in a position where in those discussions and following those discussions, the build-out OVAS and how we can bring that to bear in terms of building a much more sticky holistic relationship but one that really improves margin over time, that's a holistic piece of it that we're looking at. And we're already seeing that we have already launched in the third quarter of a really significant new value-added service that has been launched with a big merchant. And it's that kind of thing that we're -- we'll continue to grow.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Harshita Rawat: Hi. Good morning. I want to follow-up on Fastlane. Good momentum with partnerships here. Alex, you talked about 100 merchants using Fastlane. What are you hearing from some of the larger merchants ahead of the holiday season and getting into the testing? And you mentioned using your existing ball to go to deliver Fastlane experience now. How should we kind of think about like the dynamics with branded checkout experiences here? Thank you.
Alex Chriss: Hi, Harshita. Great question. So just to be clear, we're over 1,000 merchants now on Fastlane and continuing to ramp. A lot of those merchants are some of the smaller businesses, small and mid-sized businesses that are part of platforms that we were able to turn on like big commerce as an example. A lot of the large enterprises, as you can imagine, are in the middle of their holiday season. What we're hearing from them is very, very exciting feedback on ramping Fastlane as soon as they can. Oftentimes, that's going to start in Q1 to be transparent for a couple of reasons. One, a lot of their -- the code is shut down for the holiday season. Two, they want to make sure that Fastlane works across multiple processors and many of the large enterprises are using multiple processors, which is why our multiprocessor strategy for Fastlane is so important. And so, bringing on those partners, as you mentioned, processing partners is critical. But the conversations that I've had personally with a number of the large enterprises is, they're excited about Fastlane, they're ready to get on as soon as they can, and it's just about getting the work done. In terms of bringing that back to branded, we are starting to test into that as well. For us, again, if you think about the experience, we're getting the largest population of any accounts right now. These are people that have bypassed the branded experience or some of them have never been PayPal users, of which those folks that have never been PayPal users, 30% are opting in to Fastlane. So we’re now vaulting their instrument, we’re creating a profile for them, and we’re able to bring them back into the branded experience. And so for us, that’s going to be a big initiative as we go into 2025, building on those profiles, those users that continue to check out at high rates through the guest checkout experience, but sharing with them the value proposition that a PayPal branded experience has. And again, that’s why you’ve seen so much focus for us in ‘24 around building a rewards platform and starting to – even in the marketing that you’ve seen us go out, really start to burn into the minds of our consumers that PayPal is the most rewarding experience and the most rewarding way to pay because we want people to be habituated into that branded checkout experience. And we think we now have unique levers, whether it’s through PayPal Everywhere or through Fastlane to be able to bring them into that branded checkout.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Trevor Williams with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Trevor Williams: Great. Thanks a lot. I wanted to go back to the transaction take rate. I think the year-over-year decline there was a little bit bigger this quarter despite a better mix between branded and Braintree. If you could just unpack that, how you're thinking about the trajectory of the take rate from here? And then within branded, the faster relative growth of large enterprise and marketplaces versus SMBs, that's been a consistent callout from you guys. Anything more specific on how that spread looked relative to the last few quarters would be helpful. Thanks.
Jamie Miller: Hi. Good morning, Trevor. So take rate, as you know, there's a lot of factors that impact take rate, both our product mix, our geographic mix, custom mix -- customer mix, as well as pricing. And I would say, improvements in our Braintree margins are directly impacting take rate. And that's one of the things as we have lower incentives that we have improving margins, that's one of the more significant things you see impacting take rate just in terms of the overall mix shift in the numbers. And that is offset by we've also had large enterprise growth at a faster rate as compared to small and medium businesses. And that mix shift as well with large enterprises just having lower take rates than small and medium businesses, that also impacts just the math on that. And we've had some impact from FX in our payouts business as well.
Alex Chriss: I'd love to just pile on small business. This is, as you all know, a very strong passion for me. What I feel great about is the innovation that we're rolling out. PayPal Complete Payments is now really the best one-stop shop for merchants to be able to do money in and access to capital. Money out, we still have opportunities as we think about the opportunity to allow small businesses to be able to send payments to others. But overall, FX, global, Fastlane, Venmo, all these different things that we can now package together for small businesses is exactly the right product. And the feedback we're getting, especially, as we lean into no-code, low-code solutions, easy onboarding, bringing developer days, I feel really good about the innovation we have with small business. Where I'm dissatisfied right now is, it just takes time, right? This is a long tail of small businesses. You've got a touch, what is ultimately millions of merchants over a period of time. So it's just not as fast of a switch as being able to just have a handful of large enterprise conversations. But we are building the go-to-market motions. I'm very confident in what the team is bringing up, and I expect that to continue to grow and us really to make penetration in the small business as we look into 2025 and beyond.
Steve Winoker: Let's try to fit in two more questions.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Bryan Keane: Hi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask about branded checkout, the 6% growth rate. Alex, how do you think that compares to the e-commerce market and how you guys are doing versus just thinking about the share? And then with Fastlane and improvements in branded and the focus on SMB, where do you think you can get branded checkout growth rates? Do you think you can get it to high-single digits or just some kind of goals that you guys have set for the company? Thanks.
Alex Chriss: Yeah. What I'd say is, branded checkout has been very consistent. We are again, the largest, best converting and most share of branded checkout anywhere in the world, and it has been consistent. At the same time, we know there are opportunities. And the innovations that I talked about in my remarks and earlier in the call gives me confidence that we have opportunity to continue to improve that experience and grow. If you also then think about Fastlane, if you think about PayPal Everywhere, the habituation of people bringing back into the online branded experience, I think there's room for us to continue to take share there. So I'm excited about, first, you've got to have innovation. You've got to have a value proposition. I think we put those into market now and we've got the flywheel turning. So again, none of this is going to happen overnight, but I'm excited about where we go there.
Steve Winoker: We’ll take the last question.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi. Your line is open.
Andrew Schmidt: Hey, Alex. Hey, Jamie. Thanks for having me on here. I wanted to switch to the consumer side for a moment. Maybe talk about just the trajectory you see in monthly actives, especially given the, what you're seeing with the Venmo and the PayPal Everywhere promotion? And then just broadly speaking, maybe you could talk about just the pipeline just for products on the consumer side. It's just an area where we get a lot of questions in terms of the consumer fit? Thanks a lot, guys.
Alex Chriss: Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. First, what I'd say is, innovation is the most durable competitive advantage we have. And what you've seen for us in the last few quarters is really starting to drive innovation, both on the consumer PayPal app, not just in branded checkout, but actually putting real innovation into the app with PayPal Everywhere launch, giving consumers the opportunity to now have an offline experience, which is driving habituation back into online, an enhanced rewards platform. And then on the Venmo side, leading in with innovations that, to be honest, customers have been asking for, for years with scheduled payments and groups and adding direct deposit. And so when I think about customer growth, customer growth is going to be essential for us as we continue to lean in and want to grow the business but that comes through continuing to innovate and continuing to provide great products to our customers. So what I'm really most satisfied about, when I look back over the last year is, we have an innovation machine that's now starting to ramp up inside of the company. Our velocity is improving, while we're reducing tech debt. Our ability for our engineers to put more releases out into our consumers' hands. And we have a very, very healthy road map of innovation that we'll be driving to our consumers. So very excited about where we lean in over the next quarters.
Jamie Miller: Yeah. And I would just say, we've seen really steady progress in our monthly actives, both sequentially and year-over-year. And that is both the PayPal consumer and our Venmo consumers as well, also internationally. But one of the things we really haven't talked about, and I think Alex has teased in his remarks here is really PayPal Everywhere as well. And we're really excited about the launch we've had the last couple of months. We're seeing really strong adoption, really strong usage. We had more than 1 million new users since that launch. And the economics are nicely attractive on that. And it really drives habituation inflection. Just like Alex was talking about both with that core product and just the engagement with the app, the engagement with the debit card, all of those things, but also with respect to the halo effect that we see across other forms of branded spend with our products. So that's, I think, a great example of one that we're really excited about, and we'll have more of.
Steve Winoker: I know we've gone over a little bit, but Alex, any final thoughts?
Alex Chriss: Yeah. So thanks to you all, and thanks, Steve. So look, we’ve set a solid foundation to build upon, and we’re executing against our strategy. I’m very proud of our team and the momentum we’ve created for our consumers, merchants and partners. And I’m excited to deliver a solid holiday season for our customers and continue the trajectory into 2025. So take care, everyone.

2025-02-04,"Operator: Good morning and welcome to PayPal's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sarah and I will be your conference operator today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, PayPal's Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please Go ahead.
Steve Winoker : Thanks, Sarah. Welcome to PayPal's fourth quarter and full year of 2024 earnings call. I'm joined by CEO, Alex Chriss and CFO, Jamie Miller. Our remarks today include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from these statements. Our commentary is based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our earnings press release, SEC filings, and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes. Now over to you, Alex.
Alex Chriss : Thanks, Steve, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. PayPal had a successful 2024, delivering strong operating and financial results. The improvements we've made to branded checkout, P2P and Venmo. Plus the progress we have made on our price to value strategy are beginning to show up in our results. We set out at the beginning of 2024 to make it a transition year. To narrow our focus and to make sure we are executing the initiatives that matter the most to the growth of our business. One year later, I'm proud that we've laid a strong foundation for durable growth. We drove branded checkout transaction margin dollar growth in each quarter. US branded checkout growth accelerated in the fourth quarter to exit the year at a high point as our new checkout innovations are scaling to customers. Driven by a renewed focus on pricing to value, Braintree has meaningfully contributed to our transaction margin dollar growth over the last three quarters. Venmo monetization is making great strides with over 20% growth in Venmo debit card and Pay with Venmo monthly active accounts. Put simply, the PayPal team executed well during our transition year and made strong progress on our transformation. The investments we made throughout 2024 allowed us to perform well during the holiday shopping season and finished the year strongly. Total active accounts returned to growth in 2024, as we enhanced our value proposition and brought innovation to market. Total payment volume grew 10% to nearly $1.7 trillion. We delivered $32 billion in revenue up 7%. We reached an inflection point for transaction margin dollar growth, which increased 5% excluding the benefit of interest on customer balances. Our non-GAAP earnings per share increased 21% year-over-year. We generated $6.8 billion in free cash flow and completed $6 billion in share buybacks. For 2025, we expect another solid year of transaction margin dollar growth and strong free cash flow, which Jamie will discuss. As we look ahead to 2025, I want to share the areas we're most focused on. First is innovation. With the leadership team in place and the velocity with which we're executing, we've proven we can bring innovations to market. In 2024, we rolled out new branded checkout experiences, launched PayPal Everywhere, introduced Fastlane, and expanded PayPal Complete Payments. We are not stopping there and will continue to innovate to solve our customers' biggest challenges. The second is product adoption. 2025 will be focused on scaling adoption of our innovations. We have world-class products and solutions, and we'll continue educating customers about all we have to offer. In 2024, we completely revamped our marketing and go-to-market playbook. We're just scratching the surface, so you can expect more ahead. Third is partnerships. Last year we formed significant partnerships to drive Fastlane adoption and bring more value to customers. We're building on our leadership position in payments and commerce and establishing ourselves as [the platform] (ph) that leading brands want to work with. We will strike even more partnerships throughout 2025. Fourth is efficiency and effectiveness. In 2024, we reduced headcount by 10%. We made deliberate investments in AI and automation, which are critical to our future. This year, we are prioritizing the use of AI to improve the customer experience and drive efficiency and effectiveness within PayPal. We expect to make meaningful progress on all four of these areas in 2025. Let me walk you through how this focus will drive our results this year and beyond. In 2025, our key strategic initiatives will be to win checkout, scale Omni, grow Venmo, and accelerate SMB. Our teams are organized around these priorities and tracking progress daily. Starting with Win Checkout, our #1 priority. With our upgraded experiences, we now have the leading checkout solution on desktop and mobile. When fully implemented, the upgraded experiences reduce latency by more than 40% and drive more than 100 basis points of conversion lift on average, consistent with the early results we've shared. These upgrades are now live for more than 25% of U.S. Checkout traffic, which is up from 5% last quarter. We have a lot of room to grow here as adoption increases in the U.S. and then expands globally. On top of the benefit of higher conversion, these new experiences improve the presentment of our branded marks and solutions like buy-now-pay-later, which can help to expand our share of wallet. BNPL customers spend 30% more on average and merchants see higher sales after adding BNPL messaging to their sites, which is critical when one more sale can make all the difference. In 2024, we drove approximately $33 billion in BNPL total payment volume, growing 21% from the prior year. Consumers and merchants trust the PayPal brand and experience. We have a lot more we can do with BNPL in the next year. Merchants continue to show strong interest in Fastlane. In the fourth quarter we focused on selling Fastlane to large brands that can drive future volume. I'm excited to share that we have signed NBCUniversal, Roku, and StockX and are working on implementation. We now have nearly 2,000 merchants up and running with Fastlane. We expect an inflection point in adoption when we expand our go-to-market efforts and bring Fastlane to even more merchants through Adyen, Global Payments, and Pfizer this year. From early data, what's exciting is that 25% of Fastlane users have never had a PayPal account before. And more than half have a PayPal account but haven't been active in the last 12 months. To say that simply, 75% of Fastlane consumers are new or dormant PayPal users. This means that Fastlane not only improves conversion for our merchants, but also introduces more shoppers to PayPal and enables us to reengage in active users. We've shared that one of our strategies is to build deeper relationships with our largest merchants as we renegotiate deals to reflect the value we provide. A key part of that is adding value-added services that improve the experience for our mutual customers. We built a suite of world-class value-added services and continue to introduce new ones. In the fourth quarter, we launched FX-as-a-service, which is automated currency conversion, and it's already live for Meta. We also actively scaled the use of network tokens for automated billing capabilities, which is live with merchants, including Instacart, Mint Mobile, and Poshmark. The expansion of our value-added services is a key driver of the transaction margin dollar growth we are delivering. Next let's talk about our initiative to expand beyond e-commerce to become truly omnichannel. We launched PayPal Everywhere in September which is driving significant increases in debit card adoption and opening new categories of spend. We added more than 1.5 million first-time PayPal debit card users in the fourth quarter, and debit card TPV was up nearly 100% in Q4. Our most active reward categories are gas, groceries, and restaurants. These new capabilities are driving deeper relationships with our users and more PayPal volume overall, offline and online. The average debit card actives generate 5 times the transaction activity and 2 times the average revenue per account compared to users who only use Branded Checkout. This is leading to habituation. Power users, which are PayPal consumer accounts transacting more than 100 times per year, grew more than 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. So we are seeing strong momentum today with our omnichannel push, but we are just getting started. We plan to expand our PayPal Everywhere value proposition to several European markets this year, including launching NFC capabilities in Germany. Moving to our progress to grow Venmo, our task is twofold. First, continue to improve the social P2P payment experience that made Venmo a verve, increasing engagement and bringing on more users. Second, drive adoption of our monetized products, including the Venmo debit card and Pay with Venmo. In the fourth quarter, we continued improving the Venmo experience by giving our users more of the capabilities they've been asking for, like [scheduled send] (ph) and improved search. With these steady improvements to the experience, we see engagement increasing. Our engaged Venmo user base grew 4% in the quarter, reaching more than 64 million monthly active accounts. On monetization, we increased the average revenue per active Venmo account in 2024, and we plan to build on that growth in 2025. Monetized Venmo monthly active accounts beyond P2P and instant transfers grew more than 20% in the fourth quarter, driven by the adoption of Venmo debit card and Pay with Venmo. Venmo debit card monthly actives grew more than 30% and Pay with Venmo monthly actives grew more than 20%. We continue to expand Venmo's acceptance with major brands like Instacart and MoonPay, adding Venmo in the fourth quarter. And as we recently announced, JetBlue became the first airline to accept Venmo for flight bookings. So while we are still early in monetizing Venmo, we have a proven playbook that is resonating with customers. This gives us confidence as we move to 2025 and beyond. Finally, I'd like to cover our efforts to accelerate growth for SMBs. We are moving from a disparate set of payment products to building an end-to-end suite of solutions that solves more small business needs. PayPal Complete Payments was the first step towards an integrated suite of solutions, and we continue to make progress driving adoption with 45% of SMB processing and checkout volume now on this platform. Merchants on PPCP benefit from our upgraded branded checkout experiences. Key to our success in growing with small businesses on our platform is our expanding set of connected and value-added services, which move us beyond a payment provider to a growth partner and help us retain customers throughout their business life cycle. Take for example our merchant financing solutions. Entrepreneurs come to us for payment services, as they start their business. As their business grows, they need access to capital to buy inventory, invest in marketing, and higher. PayPal Working Capital is a financing solution purpose-built for early stage companies. As the business matures, PayPal Business Loan offers more traditional merchant financing to match the increasing complexity and multichannel nature of larger businesses. Our business financing solutions increase loyalty and engagement driving the PayPal flywheel. Merchants typically increase their PayPal volume by 36% after adopting PayPal Working Capital and 16% after taking a PayPal Business Loan. Our merchant lending originations were $3 billion in '24, demonstrating our leadership and that there is plenty of room to grow to support our customers. This is just one example of the services we offer that help SMBs change the trajectory of their businesses. Expanding this ecosystem of value-added services is a focus in 2025 and beyond. To close out, I want to thank the PayPal team for their focus on delivering for customers every day. I’m proud of how far we have come in the last year. It was an important transition year for PayPal. We created strong momentum that sets up well for 2025 and beyond. We are now executing a game plan that we have confidence in, and I'm excited to share more at our Investor Day later this month. With that, over to Jamie.
Jamie Miller: Thanks, Alex. Moving to Slide 7. PayPal delivered another solid quarter of results to end the year. While there is still more work to be done, the team is making progress, building on the firm foundation that we’ve established. As we enter the second year of the company's transformation, our teams are energized and moving quickly. We remain focused on better serving our customers as we seek to drive durable, profitable growth. Looking at the high level financial results in the fourth quarter. Revenue grew 4% on both a spot and currency neutral basis. For the full year, revenue grew 7% on both a spot and currency neutral basis. Transaction margin dollars grew 7% in the fourth quarter or 6% excluding the benefit of interest on customer balances. Outperformance compared to our guidance was driven by higher contribution from branded checkout and Venmo, credit performance and interest earned on customer balances. For the full year, transaction margin dollars grew 7% or 5% excluding the benefit of interest and customer balances. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.19 in the quarter, up 5%. We ended the full year with $4.65 of non-GAAP earnings per share, up 21%. These full year results benefited from a return to transaction margin dollar growth, fueled by our transformation efforts, expense discipline, the higher interest rate environment and a strong capital return program. Turning to Slide 8. Our operating metrics reflect another quarter of steady progress. Total active accounts increased by nearly $3 million from the third quarter and nearly $9 million from last year to $434 million. Monthly active accounts also continued to show steady progress, up 2% year-over-year to $229 million with contributions from PayPal consumer accounts and Venmo. Transactions per active account excluding PSP processing grew 4%. Moving to Slide 9. Total payment volume grew 7% on a spot and currency neutral basis to $438 billion. For the full year, TPV grew to nearly $1.7 trillion, up 10% on a spot and currency neutral basis. Looking at the TPV breakdown by product, we see strengths starting to build in some key areas. PayPal P2P accelerated for the sixth consecutive quarter to 6% growth. Venmo also accelerated by 2 points to 10% growth. Steady incremental product improvements combined with reinvigorated marketing campaigns are starting to make an impact. Global branded checkout volumes increased 6% on a currency neutral basis in the fourth quarter. This was about a 50 basis point acceleration from the prior quarter. Underlying this growth, we were encouraged to see U.S. branded checkout volume improve in the fourth quarter. Part of this increase can be attributed to a healthy spending environment and specific vertical exposure. In the U.S., we’re focused on scaling our modern, best-in-class experiences. From a merchant perspective, we continue to see the greatest strength across large enterprises, platforms and marketplaces. Winning checkout remains our most critical priority. Our goal is to drive more consumer engagement and a higher PayPal selection rate, which should accelerate TPV over time. Turning to PSP. As discussed throughout the past year, we moved rapidly within our Braintree business to prioritize healthy, profitable growth and intentionally let go of unprofitable volume. In-line with this strategy, PSP processing volume grew 2% in the fourth quarter compared to 11% in the third quarter. Our conversations with merchants have become more holistic, moving beyond price and share of card processing to a deeper appreciation of our customers' needs and how we can add value through our full suite of solutions. We expect a handful of large Braintree merchant renegotiations to result in a headwind to revenue growth of about 5 points in 2025. Shifting away from this volume pressures gross revenue but is accretive to transaction margin dollars and will result in more than 1 point benefit this year. We expect this benefit to build over time as we drive more value-added services. Over the next few quarters, we will continue to work through renegotiations at which point we should reach a new baseline to drive faster volume and revenue growth. Moving to more financial detail on Slide 10. Transaction revenue grew 4% on a spot basis to $7.6 billion, driven primarily by branded checkout and Venmo. Other value-added services revenue in the quarter grew 5% to $778 million. This acceleration was driven largely by a return to growth in credit revenue. We continue to see solid performance across our credit portfolio. As Alex shared, we have begun to modestly grow merchant originations and expect credit to be a positive revenue and profit driver in 2025. Transaction take rate declined by 4 basis points to 1.73%, driven largely by mix. Venmo monetization was a slight benefit, offset by merchant mix within branded checkout and Braintree, faster growth in payouts and foreign exchange. Turning to transaction margin dollars. The largest contributors were branded checkout, Venmo, interest on customer balances, a return to growth in credit and Braintree. Transaction margin percent increased by more than 100 basis points for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting our focus on price-to-value and profitable growth. As planned, we increased our level of strategic investment in the quarter, growing non-transaction operating expense by 10%. This growth included marketing spend deferred from the first half of the year and efforts to support the rollout of new products and initiatives. Non-GAAP operating income grew 2% in the quarter to $1.5 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin declined 34 basis points to 18%. PayPal generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, bringing full year free cash flow to $6.8 billion. This is meaningfully ahead of the $5 billion we planned for at the start of the year and includes some benefit from lower cash taxes, which we expect to be a headwind in 2025. In the quarter, we completed $1.2 billion in share repurchases, bringing full-year share repurchases to $6 billion. Finally, we ended the quarter with $15.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments and $11.1 billion in debt. Moving to guidance on Slide 11 for the first quarter and full year 2025. For the first quarter, we expect flat to low single-digit revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis, which is heavily impacted by the Braintree renegotiation efforts I discussed earlier. This also includes about a 1 point headwind from lapping last year's leap day. We expect transaction margin dollars to be between $3.6 billion and $3.65 billion, which represents 5% growth at the midpoint. We are planning for low single-digit non-transaction OpEx growth in the quarter, and we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.15 to $1.17 or approximately 7% growth at the midpoint. Moving to the full year. We plan to continue guiding revenue one quarter at a time. We believe this approach has served the company well during our transformation, enabling healthy long-term decision-making that prioritizes driving faster transaction margin dollar growth. Over time, we are focused on accelerating both revenue and profitability. For the full year, we expect transaction margin dollars of approximately $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion, representing approximately 4.5% growth at the midpoint. In 2024, we had a two-point benefit from interest on customer balances. For 2025, our guidance includes about a $150 million or about a 1 point headwind due to interest rate cuts. Excluding interest on customer balances, we expect transaction margin dollars to grow by at least 5% compared to 4.6% growth in 2024. In the first quarter, we expect minimal benefit from growth of interest on customer balances and then a headwind for the remainder of the year. One other factor to keep in mind is that in 2024, we saw a 1 point benefit from transaction loss improvements. We are planning for some normalization and transaction loss during 2025, as we roll out new products. Our focus in 2025 is to strike the right balance between investment and productivity, seeking to fund long-term investments largely through savings generated from better tech and automation deployment. We expect full year non-transaction operating expenses to increase in the low single-digit range. There will likely be some unevenness quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of initiatives, marketing spend and comparisons to the prior year. As a result, we expect second quarter OpEx growth to be higher than in other periods. We expect to deliver full year non-GAAP EPS in the range of $4.95 to $5.10, representing about 8% growth at the midpoint. This includes negative impact from lower interest rates and just over a two-point increase in our expected non-GAAP effective tax rate. Our guidance also includes approximately $6 billion in share buyback, and we expect full-year free cash flow of approximately $6 billion to $7 billion. I'd like to wrap up by thanking the PayPal team for their continued focus and dedication. The progress we made in 2024 gives us a strong foundation to build on, as we move into the second year of PayPal's transformation. One of our primary focuses this year will be driving adoption of recent innovation and scaling better customer experiences. It will take time for some of our efforts to build and drive financial impact, but we are confident in our road map and in our execution plans, and we're excited to share more with you at our Investor Day on February 25. With that, back to you, Alex.
Alex Chriss: Thanks, Jamie. To summarize, in 2024, we executed the transition plan we laid out. We have positioned PayPal to compete and win and delivered strong results along the way. I'm very proud of our team and the impact they made during a year of intense change. The momentum we have created sets us up well for 2025, which is about scaling adoption. It is still early in our transformation, but our objective is clear. We are evolving PayPal from a payments company to a commerce platform that helps merchants win every sale and helps consumers shop smarter. Steve, let's go to Q&A.
Steve Winoker: [Operator Instructions] Sarah, please open the line.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Schmidt with Citi. Your line is open.
Andrew Schmidt: Hi, Alex and Jamie, good to see the next stage of the transformation here. I wondered -- just digging on branded volume growth. Maybe you can just unpack the fourth quarter performance particularly in the U.S. How did it sort of trend relative to your expectation in terms of share of checkout? And then as we think about 2025, what are the right expectations to set for branded volume growth? And I know you mentioned a few things that are drivers there, your checkout integrations, reinvigorating the consumer side. Maybe just remind us what are the biggest unlocks in the time frame to see those come into play? Thanks so much.
Alex Chriss : Yes. Thank you, Andrew. Let me kick off and then hand it over to Jamie. So first, let me just remind us of the context of what we walked into at '24 on branded checkout. I talked about it throughout the course of the year as our #1 priority, and most of it was focused on how do we improve the customer experience. We felt good about the desktop experience, but clearly gaps in mobile. And that was innovation that the team really executed on throughout 2024, tested a number of different pay sheets, a number of different vaulted experiences. And then by the time we got to '24, felt really good about the innovation we were rolling out. And as we start to roll out, just as a reminder, our onetime checkout improvements is 400 basis points on conversion. Our vaulted improvement is 100 basis points on conversion. And so -- and the biggest impact is really on our mobile and our small business base. So really excited about the innovation that's now rolling out. As we talked about in Q3, we had just started to roll out. We'd ramp that to about 5% throughout Q4. We continue to execute on our rollout and got that up to 25% by the end of the year. So as we exit '24, I'm feeling really good about the quality of the innovation, our ability to roll it out and impact customers. And as we look to 2025, we now have I believe, the best-in-class experience on desktop, on mobile and starting to see knock-on effects of things like our Buy Now, Pay Later attach which is up 20% with this new pay sheet. So from an innovation perspective and a customer impact perspective, feeling really good as we go into '25.
Jamie Miller : Yes. And Andrew, good morning. Just to add on there with respect to the U.S., we did see sequential improvement in branded checkout in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. And that was about three points of growth quarter-over-quarter really due to market dynamics, but also specific key vertical exposure around travel, crypto, gaming, et cetera. Alex mentioned we are still early in the ramp of our modern checkout experience, and that is certainly something that as we get into '25, we are very, very focused on. Our biggest priorities are really around innovation, driving those improvements in checkout experience. And you mentioned also giving consumers more reasons to choose. So some of the things we've done throughout the year around really improving the app experience, adding rewards, adding different elements to how people can find contacts and things like that, all of that is around engaging the consumer in a different way. And as we talk about internally, really getting the flywheel continuing to move between our consumers and our merchant experience. So from a 2025 guide perspective, we still expect branded checkout TPV to grow about mid-single digits and to have consistent growth from last year into this year with some acceleration with our initiatives, initiatives on top of that.
Operator: The next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.
Ramsey El-Assal : Hi, thank you for taking my question this morning. As expected, unbranded volumes decelerated again as you pursue the price-to-value strategy. Can you give us your updated thoughts on your sort of confidence level, timing and toolkit to reaccelerate unbranded volume growth at the higher baseline profitability levels as we move forward here?
Alex Chriss : Yes. Let me just touch on -- thanks for the question, Ramsey. And let me touch on just how we're -- how these conversations are evolving. So first, again this has been our strategy throughout the year. I'm encouraged to see just another quarter of branded/unbranded Braintree contribution to TM dollar growth. The conversations are continuing to be strategic in nature, which is exciting for us. We are having not just processing conversations, but now they are sort of evolving into two steps. One is the value-added services that we are bringing to market. I mentioned some of these FX-as-a-Service, Risk-as-a-Service, chargeback automation, orchestration all of these are things that we are now able to price to value and monetize, as part of a best-in-class unbranded offering. In addition, though, we are really starting to differentiate ourselves in these conversations by being able to bring customers to the conversation. And so again, as I sit down with CEOs of some of our largest customers and really talk about what are their greatest needs, it goes well beyond just processing. It really goes to how do we bring more customers to bear. And this is really the first time that we are leveraging the two-sided network that PayPal has and being able to say, hey we have hundreds of millions of consumers around the world. We now have an ads platform, we have reward platforms. We have the ability to enable our unbranded processing customers to create rewards and offers inside of our PayPal app to be able to drive additional growth for them. And so these become really fun conversations, to be honest, because we are now having holistic, not just processing but end-to-end, how do we leverage their marketing dollars, how do we leverage their ability to acquire customers in our two-sided network.
Jamie Miller : Yes. And with respect to forward trends on this, we do expect similar dynamics in the next few quarters, some volatility. I mean, this is not something that just happens in a perfect line. And we still do have some large agreements over the next couple of years that we will work our way through. But the revenue growth should build as we lap some of the larger agreements fluffing-off over time. For 2025, we expect the renegotiations to be about a 5-point revenue growth headwind. But the other important point here is that it's a 1-point accretive on the TM dollars growth in 2025. So I think an important dynamic there that as you mentioned, we are very intentionally driving.
Operator: The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Jason Kupferberg : Good morning guys. I just wanted to come back to the branded TPV topic. I think you mentioned U.S. accelerated 3 points in the quarter, if I caught that right. I guess that would imply international slowed. So perhaps you can quantify that and then maybe give us a sense of how that mid-single digit global branded volume outlook for '25 splits between U.S. and non-U.S. And just a little bit of color on how the transaction margin profile differs between U.S. and international branded. Thanks guys.
Jamie Miller : Good morning Jason. With respect to international, we are still in a very strong market position there and we continue to take share internationally. We had less than a full point international pullback. Just some softness in Europe is what I would say. And when you look at the split, international to U.S., both in the TPV line and in the TM line, it is really 50-50. And from a margin perspective, it is slightly healthier outside the U.S. but it's very much in-line.
Operator: The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Tien-Tsin Huang : Hi good morning. Thanks for the update. Just on grow Venmo. Can you just -- I know you'll talk a lot about it on February 25, but is it more about user growth, new products or ARPU from existing products expanding? Just curious what the algorithm is there. If you don't mind, a quick clarification. The step-up in CapEx in 2025, is that more of a one-time issue? Is it a sustainable level for you to consider? Thanks.
Alex Chriss : Hi, Tien-Tsin, let me hit Venmo and then hand it over to Jamie. So on Venmo, and again, we will -- it will be exciting to see you all at Investor Day and we'll certainly dive deep on Venmo. But really, it is both customer growth as well as monetization growth. Again, we are excited. Venmo is the #1 P2P platform in the U.S. We saw MAAs continue to grow to $63 million by the end of this year. We are seeing TPV continue to grow up 10%, hitting double digits really for the first-time in I think, seven, eight quarters, up to $76 billion. So really exciting to see the continuation of growth and active users. In terms of our focus on monetization again, we've been consistent. This is about proven levers of debit card MAA growth, which was up 32%; and Pay with Venmo MAA growth, which was up 22%. The reason this is important is we've seen that debit card MAA delivers average revenue per account 4 times, when they adopt our debit card, and Pay with Venmo average revenue per account is up 3 times. And just as a reminder, we are in single-digit penetration across both of those products across the base. And so as we continue to grow customers, we are growing active customers and we are starting to grow penetration of monetizable elements. So this is exciting for us. We also will just continue to focus on innovation. I think we are just scratching the surface of a very engaged, highly valuable demographic. We've rolled-out new innovations like scheduled send and gifting and groups and direct deposits to bring more money into the ecosystem. But the team is a really, really exciting road map for '25, as we start to really think about what are the other needs -- once this money is in the ecosystem of Venmo. What are the other needs that our customers have to be able to enable them to be able to spend in an omnichannel way and obviously move money across each other. So exciting about what Venmo will have, and we've built a very good baseline of monetization throughout '24, which sets us up well for '25.
Jamie Miller : Good. And then with respect to CapEx, we are seeing, over the next two years, an increase in the program to about $200 million to $300 million. And it relates to tech infra build-out and data center build-out in connection with both platform consolidation and a few other things. But after the two years, it should come down.
Operator: The next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Darrin Peller : Yeah. Thanks guys. Jamie, I think you said you would expect stable branded growth through '25, based on what you're -- what's built into your outlook. You guys have initiatives now where 25% of your checkout experience is on the more modern checkout, which I know has kind of ramped through the end of last year and were there now, and so it should impact, I think. The debit card is more further out. Marketing has been more substantial. I guess I'm just curious when those initiatives you think would have a more material impact. Or are they embedded in your outlook that they could have an impact on branded acceleration as the year progresses? Are you just building in uncertainty around things like international, maybe Germany or any other softness? And then just my one quick follow-on would be the exit rate of transaction margin growth ex flows, I think 6%, in the context of this 6% branded. So I'm just curious, when you think of your forecast, is there anything about this fourth quarter growth rate that was unsustainable other than maybe leap year? Otherwise, you're 5%, and I think you've added 5% plus, so it we may capture that. Thanks guys.
Jamie Miller : Yes. So first, let us talk about the branded checkout growth in 2025. You were specifically asking about initiatives. And as Alex mentioned, we've got 25% of our U.S. TPV flowing through the most modern checkout experiences at this point. That is something that we expect to scale as we get into '25. And in addition, we are going global with that as well. So to your point, we do expect some impact from that to start to flow through. And we have embedded some of that in our guide, and we expect it to build over time. Having said that, we also think we've prudently planned here. And I wouldn't say, we've explicitly put an overlay for European softness in there. Having said that, we've left ourselves room for to navigate different things because as we roll this out, the impact of how this will flow through may be uneven as we see it. And then Darrin remind me of your second question? It was on TM, but I didn't pick up the exact question you were asking.
Darrin Peller : Growth rate, you're at 6% already without any acceleration in the underlying KPI despite all the initiatives you've done. And you're guiding 5% plus -- I guess, 5% plus, right from a non-float impacted. So just making sure there is nothing unsustainable in Q4's exit rate that should inform you on '25's growth.
Jamie Miller : Yes. When you look at '25 from a TM perspective, there is probably two things to think about that are headwinds to 2025 TM. The first is we expect transaction loss to normalize as we get into the year. We had a full point benefit of that in '24 and -- or a full basis point benefit. And when we get into 2025, we expect about 0.5 basis point headwind. And really, we are growing products that should carry with it a higher transaction loss rate. And then you mentioned the 6%. I would talk a little bit, even though around interest rates. When you look at total all-in TM, we are expecting about $150 million of interest rate headwind on all-in TM there, too. But when you look at the underlying profile of TM which really revolved around branded checkout, Braintree, Venmo, credit, I mean all of those things are things that we believe are durable it is clearly diverse and things that we fully expect to continue as we get into '25 and beyond.
Alex Chriss: And Darrin, I just -- I want to pile on to Jamie's comments as well because I think it is really important to set our branded checkout strategy in context. First, as Jamie said, and I think we've been consistent throughout the year, we are excited about the innovations. I think we've been pretty prudent in the way that we have looked at a forward guide. We want to see the results before we tell you they're coming. But if I just step back and think about the strategy, think about what we did in '24, we really worked on innovation and what I would call just fixing the basics of branded checkout. As I described earlier, an improved product now in the hands of customers on both desktop and mobile, and we are now starting to see that scale as you mentioned, up to 25%. And we'll continue to scale that throughout the quarter and the rest of '25. We've expanded to check out to guest checkout, which we weren't playing in before. And now we are starting to bring in new users through our Fastlane product, which again needs to continue to scale and will scale over the next few years. But we now have innovation in market that is best-in-class to go after the guest checkout experience. We expanded to off-line. So now we are playing in an omnichannel world where it is not just branded, but we're seeing off-line commerce that we didn't see before. And it's driving habituation. Our debit card users are transacting twice as much as just a branded user and driving 20% higher average revenue per active. So we are just starting to put together a holistic strategy here that's beyond just a single button experience, but really starting to engage our growing customer base -- our growing monthly active customer base in a holistic way, where we really can be their commerce partner going forward.
Operator: The next question comes from Timothy Chiodo with UBS. Your line is open.
Timothy Chiodo: Great. Thank you for taking the question. So in the past, and when we talked about the mix within the branded checkout, we typically talked about it being very skewed to discretionary and to goods. And in prior periods of strong discretionary growth during 2020, 2021, the branded checkout button grew in-line if not faster, depending on the metric or the industry data that you are looking at. The growth was better than the industry. Could you maybe talk a little bit about how that mix might have evolved, if at all? And if we were to expect a better period of discretionary spend, should we see another period of the branded checkout button growing in line, if not faster, than the industry?
Jamie Miller: Good morning Tim. So when you look at the composition of our verticals now, I would say that one of the things we've done a really nice job of in the last couple of years is really expanding to services. And when you look at some of the dynamics that you might have seen three years or four years ago, when you shift to now, we are just more balanced across different verticals. And I mentioned some of the growth in a few of the areas, but services in particular is one that has been a larger space. So I expect the dynamic to be more muted with respect to that discretionary side of it, on the good side of it.
Operator: The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.
Sanjay Sakhrani: Thank you good morning. Just a follow-up question on the U.S. branded volume. I think, Alex, you mentioned that it exited the quarter at the high point. I mean, is there any color on sort of what that growth rate was and how it trended into this new year quarter-to-date?
Jamie Miller : Yes. So really, the way I think about branded U.S. is that we have been moving along, and we are obviously very focused on continuing to shift, continuing to impact our U.S. market position. And Alex talked about a lot of the innovation, specifically around mobile and around a couple of other areas that is really focused on driving shifting there. We saw some lapping in the first part of the year. But as we hit third quarter and into fourth quarter in particular, that was pure growth off a base. And that 3 points was reflective of that.
Operator: The next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is open.
Colin Sebastian: Thanks. And good morning. Maybe turning to the non-transaction expenses for the year. I was just hoping you could maybe expand on, first I guess, the ability to use AI for more operating efficiency. And are those initiatives that are requiring some incremental investment near-term? Or are you already seeing sort of a positive ROI from that? And relatedly, with the focus on scaling innovations and educating consumers, I guess what does that mean specifically in terms of the investments in customer acquisition and rewards that might be impacting margins -- operating margins through the year? Thank you.
Alex Chriss : Yes. Thank you, Colin. Let me start with AI and then maybe hand it over to Jamie. AI is opening up a huge opportunity for us. First, at our scale, we saw 26 billion transactions on our platform last year. We have a massive data set that we are actively working and investing in to be able to drive our effectiveness and efficiency. Let me break it into a couple of different pieces. First, on the customer-facing side, we're leveraging AI to really become more efficient in our support cases and how we interact with our customers. We see tens of millions of support cases every year, and we've rolled out our PayPal Assistant, which is now really cutting down phone calls and active events that we have. We also are leveraging AI to personalize the commerce journey, and so working with our merchants to be able to understand and create this really magical experience for consumers. When they show up at checkout. It is not just a static button anymore. This really can become a dynamic, personalized button that starts to understand the profile of the consumer, the journey that they've been on perhaps across merchants and be able to enable a reward or a cashback offer in the moment or even a Buy Now, Pay Later offer in a dynamic experience. And so this is all AI-enabled and all things that will generate both efficiency for us from the consumer standpoint, but also drive more branded checkout and more sales for our merchants. In addition, we also are looking at our back office and ensuring that not just on the engineering and employee productivity side, but also in things like our risk decisions. We see billions and billions of risk decisions that often to be honest, we are very manual in the past. We are now leveraging AI to be able to understand globally what are the nature of these risk decisions and how do we automate these across both risk models, as well as even just ensuring that customers get the right response at the right time in an automated fashion.
Jamie Miller : Yes. And then with respect to scaling consumer and non-transaction OpEx, we increased our marketing spend in 2024 by about $250 million, and we were very focused around really reinvigorating the brand and then really reinforcing the consumer value prop as we did it. And as we get into 2025, we will be increasing marketing slightly. Our total OpEx guide is up low single digits. I would say marketing is up low single digits plus in terms of how we look at it, heavily weighted towards the second quarter, as we really look at the profile throughout the year. But it is been very targeted. And we've seen the results of that starting to come true with consumer MAAs up sequentially. We saw debit card MAAs up sequentially. We are seeing P2P improvement. So there is been a nice kind of flow through of what we've seen. We've got some CAC, or customer acquisition cost, budgeted for this year but we really haven't started deploying that yet. We've been testing that. But the full suite will be things that we'll be looking to deploy as we get into 2025.
Operator: The next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Harshita Rawat: Hi, good morning. I want to follow-up on Fastlane. You talked about the new merchant wins. Now that the holiday season is over, and the merchants are more open to integrating new solutions, how are those conversations going with large merchants especially because there is also some competitive dynamics there? And then, Alex, you also talked about 75% of Fastlane consumers kind of being new or dormant PayPal users. Can you just remind us about how you are converting those into PayPal users? Thank you.
Alex Chriss : Yes. Thanks, Harshita. So you are exactly right. So guest checkout, just as a reminder, for Fastlane, this is really six months in the market. So it is still brand new. There are other guest checkout experiences that have been in the market for -- some for many years, one almost up to a decade. And so we are the new entrant, but we are delivering the best converting experience for our merchants. And that's what gets us really excited. As we start to scale our Fastlane experience, we’re still continuing to deliver double-digit lift in conversion for our merchants. And so our focus -- our go-to-market focus has been really on those enterprise merchants, on the largest ones. I mentioned a few on the call, NBCUniversal, Roku, StockX. And this has been obviously set up conversations throughout the holiday season as many of them weren't ready to actually do the integration. But now as we get into '25, it is full steam ahead. Now just as a reminder, as we have these conversations, they’re very excited about the conversion uplift. Guest checkout is also not something that they've spent a lot of time playing around with. So it is not like these merchants have a scrum team sitting there ready to play around with guest checkout. So they're working on their road maps. So the conversations have been great. It is now about getting implementation done. And I do think this will take a number of quarters for us to really scale this out across the merchant base. But the conversations are exciting, merchants are on board, and I think we'll continue to see this scale. To your question on what we are seeing from a customer perspective, again, we -- 25% of Fastlane users that are coming in are new to PayPal. 50% were dormant in the last 12 months. And again, these are customers that are opting into Fastlane at 45% clip. So we are continuing to see customers choosing to, once they go into that guest checkout experience, actually opt into the Fastlane experience. To us, this is just scratching the surface of being able to now reinvigorate them. So we started to really ramp up our marketing efforts. It is still early, and it is through both off-line channels, things like e-mail, testing notifications, as well as online through the app to find incentives and reasons for these consumers to be able to reengage in the PayPal experience. The good news is – it is sort of a second bite at the apple, right? They have gone past the branded experience, they've gone through a guest checkout experience. We've accelerated it for them and for merchants. We've created that conversion. And now we can go and remind those consumers what a great experience a cash-back offer, a package tracking offer, a full end-to-end experience they could have gotten through a branded checkout. And we are going to continue to lean into that to reignite those users into being more consistent active users on PayPal. The last thing just that I'd say, as context is our PayPal users that are online don't use PayPal for every single one of their purchases. This is why the omnichannel habituation and just continuing to drive up not just our MAAs but those power users that I talked about that are really using us for all of their purchases, is so important to us. Because we still have users that love PayPal, have an active app, use us but still use us for just a fraction. And so our ability, even through the Fastlane experience to gather those users up and remind them of the benefits of actually going through the branded experience of PayPal, is so important and will ultimately drive to our branded checkout growth. Sarah, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Trevor Williams with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Trevor Williams: Great. Thanks a lot. I wanted to go back to Venmo. Jamie, it sounded like next to branded, it was one of the biggest contributors to TM dollar growth in Q4. You guys have given some good stats on attach rate and user growth across the different buckets. But it would be helpful if we could get an updated transaction margin dollar number for Venmo. And then anything more just on the current mix of revenue across the different buckets, debit card, Pay with Venmo, Instant Transfer? And then just how you're thinking about Venmo's contribution to transaction margin dollar growth in '25. Thanks.
Jamie Miller : Yes. So Venmo has been a growing contributor to transaction margin dollar growth. Certainly in '24, it was behind interest branded checkout, Braintree et cetera. As we get into 2025, it continues to grow in terms of its impact on TM which is really great to see. When you look at -- our Venmo TPV was up 10% in the fourth quarter. Our debit card TPV was up 40%. Pay with Venmo was up 50%. P2P was up 8%. So we are really excited about not only the core P2P continued strength but also just the beginnings of the investments we are making in debit and Pay with Venmo which, when we really dig into this, which is really our new Venmo leaders' target in 2025, we are excited about the growth we can drive. When we get to Investor Day at the end of February, we will unpack this with a lot more detail, and we are looking forward to talking to you all there.
Steve Winoker: Alex, any final thoughts?
Alex Chriss : No, just a huge thank you to all of you, and thanks, Steve. I look forward to seeing many of you later this month at our Investor Day on February 25, where we will share our vision for the future and dive into our strategies for medium and long-term growth and what it's going to take to get us there. So take care, everyone.

2024,Q1,2024-05-08,"Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Robinhood First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Chris Koegel, VP of Corporate FP&A and Investor Relations. You may begin.
Chris Koegel: Thank you, Joanna, and thank you to everyone for joining Robinhood's Q1 earnings call. With us today are our CEO, and Co-Founder, Vlad Tenev; and CFO, Jason Warnick. Before getting started, I want to remind you that today's call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations, and we have no duty to provide updates unless legally required. Potential risk factors that could cause differences, including regulatory developments that we continue to monitor, are described in the press release we issued today, the earnings presentation, and our SEC filings, all of which can be found at investors.robinhood.com. Today's discussion will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the GAAP results we consider most comparable can be found in the earnings presentation. With that, let me turn it over to Vlad.
Vlad Tenev: Thanks, Chris. Hi, everyone. I again will keep my remarks short so that we can have plenty of time for questions. So, just to remind everyone, Robinhood is focused on three things: number one, winning the active trader market; number two, increasing wallet share with our customers; and number three, expanding internationally. We believe the strategy is working and it led to strong business outcomes in Q1. First, retail market -- retail trading market share. It can continue to increase in Q1 and it was really bolstered by our product innovation. As a result, year-over-year notional trading volumes were up significantly across equities, options and crypto. Net deposits, they were a record $11.2 billion with strong diversity across brokerage, cash sweep, and retirement. This translates to a 44% annualized organic growth rate and continues our multi-year track record of delivering 20%-plus net deposit growth. And customers are also moving their assets to Robinhood in record numbers. Q1 was the second quarter in a row we had net asset inflows from every other major brokerage, totaling nearly $3 billion, more than twice our Q4 level. I also wanted to highlight Gold subscribers. Customers are finding our Gold offerings compelling across high-yield cash, retirement, margin rates, and now our Gold credit card. This led Gold subscribers to reach 1.7 million in Q1, higher than at any other point in our history. The 260,000 Gold subscribers we added in Q1 was the fastest in the past three years. It's also exciting to see that nearly 20% of new funded customers in Q1 subscribed to Gold, and that's more than double a year ago. Putting this all together with continued expense discipline led to record revenues of 40% year-over-year, and record GAAP EPS of positive $0.18. Now what's even more exciting is that we continue to deliver amazing value to customers. And before I share more about what we're doing for our Gold customers, let's have Jason review our financial results.
Jason Warnick: Thanks, Vlad. It's good to speak with everyone today. As a reminder, last year we drove significant profitable growth, with revenue up 37% and adjusted EBITDA margins expanding by 36 points. In 2024, we are focused on driving another year of profitable growth and we had a strong Q1, with 40% year-over-year revenue growth and 14 points of margin expansion from a year ago. We also set records in Q1 for quarterly revenues, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, net income, and GAAP EPS. Looking more closely at our Q1 results compared to a year ago, total net revenues grew 40% to $618 million; adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $247 million; incremental margins were 75%, demonstrating the scalability of our cost structure even while we increased marketing and growth investments; and adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 14 points to 40% as we make progress over time towards the 50%-plus levels we see from incumbents. All of this led to net income of $157 million, or $0.18 of EPS. We're pleased with our results in Q1 and we aim to continue delivering profitable growth in 2024. Now, let's move to our first quarter business results. Assets under custody finished Q1 at around -- at a record $130 billion, up 65% year-over-year. A key driver of that asset growth was strong Q1 net deposits of over $11 billion, which is more than double last year's quarterly average, and translates to a 44% annualized growth rate. We are encouraged by the breadth and durability of Q1 net deposits. So, let me share a little more color. First, we saw strong participation from both existing and new customers, with about 75% of net deposits coming from customers who've been at Robinhood for over a year. Second, we saw a nice mix of continued strong contributions from customers and wins versus brokerage incumbents. The mix was about 75% contributions from customers and 25% net wins from incumbents. And third, deposits into our platform were balanced across product categories, a little more than half of Q1 net deposits went to brokerage, another quarter went to cash sweep, and the last 20% to retirement. So overall, we are really pleased with the diversity of net deposits as customers engage with us across our platform. Looking at Q2, so far it's off to a good start as well, as April was our highest month of the year for net deposits with nearly $5 billion. And with our continued progress in early May, we've already brought in more net deposits year-to-date than the $17 billion we did in all of 2023, with most of the year still in front of us. We're also delivering growth in Robinhood Gold. As a reminder of how Gold subscribers on average compare to our customers overall, in Q1, Gold subscribers had 8 times the [assets] (ph) with an average of over $40,000, grew net deposits roughly twice as fast, and had 5 times the retirement account adoption. Gold ARPU is also multiples of our average customer, which includes annualized recurring subscription revenue approaching $100 million. And in Q1, we grew Gold subscribers to 1.7 million, up 42%, or 500,000 from last year. This momentum has continued into Q2 as we added another 140,000 Gold subscribers in April, more than half of our Q1 growth. Let's now turn to our financial results. In the first quarter, we generated net income of $157 million, up 5x sequentially as we grew revenues and stayed disciplined on expenses. Looking at Q1 revenues, transaction-based revenues increased sequentially across equities, options, and crypto, and net interest revenues grew as a result of higher balances and securities lending activity. So far in Q2, we've continued to see robust trading. In April, equity notional volumes were about $70 billion; options contracts were a monthly record of roughly $125 million; and crypto notional volumes were around $10 billion. Now let's turn to first quarter expenses. Combined adjusted OpEx and SBC was $460 million in Q1, as we stayed disciplined on expenses even as we increased investments in marketing and growth. Looking ahead, while the year is off to a strong start, we know it's important to stay disciplined on expenses. So, our full year adjusted OpEx and SBC outlook is unchanged in the range of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion. Before I pass the call back to Vlad, I want to share some perspectives about our opportunity to drive profitable growth in 2024 and the years to come by growing revenues and expanding margins. First, we believe we can continue our multi-year track record of delivering 20%-plus net deposit growth rates, supported by a young customer base gaining share of global wealth, share gains in existing markets, and expansion into new markets and product categories that give us more opportunity for growth. Second, as customer assets grow over time, we believe this will drive strong revenue growth as well. We are naturally hedged between interest rates and trading, and we continue to diversify our business as we introduce new products and enter new markets. And third, we're a technology company and a highly scalable platform with about 90% fixed costs. So, as our revenues increase, we believe we can drive significant margin expansion and free cash flow. In closing, we had a strong Q1, and we have a lot of momentum to start the second quarter. We remain focused on driving profitable growth for shareholders as we work to maximize EPS and free cash flow per share in 2024 and the years to come. Now, I'll turn the call back to Vlad.
Vlad Tenev: Thanks, Jason. As I said earlier, the second part of our strategy is increasing wallet share with customers, including growing Robinhood Gold subscriptions, which hit an all-time high of 1.7 million in Q1. In March, we held Robinhood's first-ever keynote event to introduce even more value that we are providing Gold customers, including an all-new customizable app experience, a 1% unlimited deposit boost for Gold customers that's launching soon, and a brand new Robinhood Gold credit card with 3% back on all purchases. We're seeing lots of commentary about how amazing of a deal Gold is, and we're happy customers are recognizing that and starting to spread the word. Over 1 million people have signed up for the Gold card waitlist, only half of which are Gold subscribers today. So, we believe we can substantially grow Gold adoption as we roll out the card. We love seeing the progress we're making, attracting, retaining, and expanding Gold customer relationships on the journey to be the most trusted, lowest-cost, and most culturally-relevant money app worldwide. I want to thank our customers for continuing to trust and advocate for the platform as we make progress on our mission to democratize finance for all. The business is in a great position because of you and we're just getting started. And you should know our team has been working incredibly hard to deliver even more value to you. The roadmap is full. There's so much to do. And now, let's move on to questions.
A - Chris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Vlad. For the Q&A session, we'll start by answering the top few shareholder questions from Say Technologies ranked by a number of votes. We passed over questions that we had already addressed on this call or in prior quarters and grouped together questions that shared a common theme. After the Say questions, we'll turn to live questions from our analysts. So, we'll kick it off with our first question from Say. Alexander M. asks, what impact will the SEC Wells notice have on the business? Jason, do you want to start on that one?
Jason Warnick: Yeah, I'll maybe start and then Vlad can add some thoughts. First, for our customers, your accounts are not affected by this. It's business as usual for Robinhood Crypto. We're, of course, disappointed to have received the notice. As you know, we've operated our crypto business in good faith. We've been very conservative in our approach in terms of coins listed and services offered. And we're a highly regulated company and have applied the same legal and compliance standards we use for our brokerage to the way we run our crypto business. So, it's disappointing to see more regulation by enforcement here. Vlad?
Vlad Tenev: Yeah. I mean, echoing Jason, this is a disappointing development. We firmly believe U.S. consumers should have access to this asset class. They deserve to be on equal footing with people all over the world. And at the end of the day, we're going to defend the firm and continue to advocate for our customers.
Chris Koegel: Great. Thank you. The next question is from Joseph C., who asks, when are the new credit cards getting fully released? It seems that many are still on the waiting list. Vlad, do you want to start that one?
Vlad Tenev: Yeah, I'll take that one. Thanks for the question. First of all, we are really excited about the Gold card and the value that we're going to be providing to customers. We've seen a ton of demand. I mentioned earlier, over 1 million customers have signed up for the waitlist so far. And the product is looking great. You might have noticed we've dropped the credit card app on the app store and we've rolled it out to the first customers outside of the company. As we think about this roll out, we really want to balance the desire to get the card to customers as quickly as we can with making sure that we are managing risk to the capital well as we enter a new market for us. So, we are starting with an initial group in the tens of thousands of customers over the next few weeks. And then, we're going to observe them carefully, look at the data, watch the spending activity and the borrowing activity, and we're going to use that information to inform the broader roll out of the card. We really want to make sure that we're being very, very prudent as we do this roll out since this is a new business line for the company.
Chris Koegel: Great. Thank you, Vlad. And then, the third question from Say is from Daniel R., who asks, 24 Hour Market was halted. How can we trust that the platform when markets become volatile, what steps are being implemented to handle future volatility?
Vlad Tenev: Well, first, it's really been awesome to see how much interest there is in our 24 Hour Market offering. Over 10 billion in volumes have transacted in the overnight section since it launched a year ago. And we now offer overnight trading in over 900 names. And really, this is one of the core differentiators of Robinhood. You don't find this type of offering elsewhere easily. As for why trading was affected? So, in order to facilitate these trades, we route to a third-party ATS. The ATS we use went down for the evening. This affected us, but also other firms that route to it. But the ATS was able to support trading again in a handful of hours. Looking ahead, we're really on the frontier with this offering, but as we continue to invest in it, the offering will improve over time and it will get more resilient. So, believe us when we say that we're committed to making sure this offering is reliable and more feature-rich going forward.
Chris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Vlad. That concludes our shareholder questions from Say Technologies. We appreciate our shareholders taking the time to ask these questions to Vlad and Jason and look forward to more next quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Joanna to lead Q&A from analysts.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP. Your line is open.
Devin Ryan: Hey, thanks so much. Hi, Vlad. Hi, Jason. How are you?
Vlad Tenev: Hey, Devin.
Devin Ryan: I want to ask a question on the growth in new deposits. I mean, just really impressive momentum there and good to hear the second quarter is accelerating further. And it feels like you're just scratching the surface on Gold adoption, I think Vlad as you talked about. And I also think that the offering really stands out in the market. So, with that said, I heard Jason's comments on better ARPU for Gold customers, but is it possible to kind of simplistically unpack the economics you're expecting on new deposits coming into a Gold-connected account under these new promotions relative to deposits that aren't or even kind of like revenue per asset under kind of the model prior to these promotions? I'm just trying to think about the economics kind of [indiscernible] dollars coming in because it seems like you're seeing a really nice acceleration there. Thank you.
Jason Warnick: Yeah. Thanks, Devin. It's Jason. I'll go ahead and take that. So in short, we love the economics of the match promotions that we've been running. I think I said last quarter that the payback on the 1% match is a little under a year, and on the 3% match, it's between two and three years. And we're watching that closely kind of on a monthly cohort basis with our customers. We're seeing the 2023 cohorts already paying off and 2024 is off to a great start. We mentioned on our prepared remarks too that the strength of net deposits, 44% annualized growth rate is really well-diversified between customers that have been at the company for -- have been at Robinhood for over a year, representing 75% of those net deposits. And we are also seeing that 75% cut a different way are unrelated to the promotion. So, really strong promotion response, but it's only a small part of the strength of the overall deposits for the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is open.
Dan Dolev: Hey guys, thank you for taking my question. Great results out there. Really, really nice.
Vlad Tenev: Thanks, Dan.
Dan Dolev: Of course. Yes, so you mentioned some really strong numbers in April, really strong momentum. Can you maybe elaborate a little more regarding the momentum that you're seeing heading into the second quarter? Any color and additional views on the momentum would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
Jason Warnick: Yeah, absolutely, Dan. I mean -- so we're seeing strong trading across equities, options, and crypto continuing into the next quarter. We're seeing strength kind of across the business as well in terms of new Gold subscribers. We mentioned and you mentioned the strength in net deposits, nearly $5 billion. So, we're really seeing great diversity of the strength. Retirement assets are now crossing over $7 billion, which is just remarkable growth and we love to see our customers saving for the long-term with us. We're going to share our metrics, I think next week on the month of April and so you'll get a fuller picture there. But it's really across the board, whether it's sec lending or trading or net deposits.
Vlad Tenev: Yeah. And I would just add, we are, of course, excited about the Q1 performance and the start to Q2. Well, I think we have some medium and longer-term tailwinds to the business. The Gold benefits that we announced in March, including the 1% deposit match, which really has resonated quite strongly with customers based on early feedback, has yet to launch. We're entering a new product category with the credit card. And we've also been working on our futures and web Pro product for active traders. And we here get an early look at the products that we're building and the teams have been working incredibly hard to make what we believe are incredibly polished products that we're very excited about. So, I think we tend to get excited about things on a quarterly basis, but we're running this business for the long-term and I think that you'll see a lot more from us.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Steven Chubak: Hi. Good afternoon, Vlad. Good afternoon, Jason.
Jason Warnick: Hello?
Vlad Tenev: Hey, Steven.
Steven Chubak: Yeah. So, I wanted to start off with a question just on the incremental margin ex-SBC coming in at 75%, certainly a good outcome. As we think about the incremental profitability as the business scales, is that 75% bogey a reasonable expectation for investors to underwrite? And just trying to gauge whether there's room for even further operating leverage, or upside given the marketing spend was actually relatively elevated in the quarter as well?
Jason Warnick: Yeah, thanks for the question. So, we are not providing guidance necessarily on incremental margins. What I'd tell you is, as I've said in previous sessions, that about 90% of our cost structure is fixed, meaning that 10% of our costs kind of are variable relative to the activity of our platform. So that gives us a lot of opportunity to drop incremental revenue to the bottom-line. You're seeing us this year make a really big step up in marketing, about $100 million year-over-year is our plan to spend in marketing versus last year. And as Vlad was touching on in the last question, we are making a lot of investments and not sitting still. And even with all this step up in marketing and investments for growth, we're delivering incremental margins at 75%. So, we feel really good about that. We're going to continue to watch our costs. Excited to see revenue per employee cross over $1 million. I think that there's a lot of opportunity to expand margins going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.
Kyle Voigt: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a question on the Gold card. Obviously, the offering is very compelling, and great to see the demand with the waitlist at over 1 million users already. But just wondering if you could expand upon the expected economics a bit. You've noted the $300 ARPU previously, but that was for X1 with a relatively small subset of users that you ultimately ramp to with this offering. And just given how attractive the card might be for some more transactor types and those don't carry a balance, are you still confident in your ability to profitably monetize a broad range of potential new clients? And then, if I just add a second part of that question. Can you give us any flavor on what you might expect on the transaction revenue side for the offering specifically? I'm assuming maybe some level of headwind after netting out interchange in rewards, but wondering if you can kind of frame that. Thank you.
Jason Warnick: Yeah, you bet. Thanks, Kyle, for the question. It's Jason. I'll go ahead and take that. The first point I'd make on the credit card is that we think it's really strategically aligned with our vision that we want to serve all of our customers' assets and process all of their financial transactions and having a great value credit card, I think is really fundamental to that vision. That said, we need to do this in a prudent way and in a way that makes sense economically for the company. And on that point, I think that we've got a few things that are going to benefit us. First of all, we're going to be able to leverage our scale. We're seeing that already play out with a low CAC. We have over 1 million customers on the waitlist with essentially no marketing dollars against that. And when you look at competitors, they're spending several hundred dollars, perhaps $500 per customer to acquire a customer. And so, we really love the low CAC opportunity to -- that leverages our platform. We're also able versus X1 to get even better economics. And for example, cost of funds, we've already been able to improve by over 300 basis points because of our strong balance sheet and because of our strength in the financial results. And so, those are a couple of areas that I'd point out. And then thirdly, I'd say that we have an opportunity to benefit because of our deeper relationship with customers. It's going to help us understand better the customers that we are underwriting and make better decisions, and over time, have an opportunity to offer collateralized cards, which would also help with our economics. As Vlad -- I'd just finished with, as Vlad pointed out, we're going to be really careful and prudent here. We're rolling it out to tens of thousands of customers and we're going to take months to look at how our customers are responding, how they're using the card, their borrowing and repayment activity, and we are going to use that to inform our broader roll out. And the last point, I would make is two-thirds of our customers are prime or higher in terms of credit rating. And so, we do have a high-quality customer base. And so together with the prudent roll out and the high-quality customers and benefiting from our scale and our deeper relationships with customers, we think we can land a good economic outcome for Robinhood.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Mike Cyprys: Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about capital allocation. Hoping you could update us just around your latest thoughts there with $5 billion of balance sheet cash and investments. Just curious how you're thinking about the appetite for dividends, buybacks, M&A, where M&A can be most additive at this point, given you just added on the card platform side? And then just on a minute, maybe just remind us of your hurdle rates and criteria there? Thank you.
Jason Warnick: Yeah, thanks, Mike. We love the strong balance sheet, over $5 billion of corporate cash. Three ways to use the capital to the benefit of shareholders. One is just investing in our business for organic growth and you're seeing us do that with their incremental investments for growth, including the $100 million step-up in marketing this year. The second is M&A. You've seen us recently acquire X1. We have a very active Corp Dev team and we're looking at several opportunities there that can either augment our team, the talent of our team, or accelerate our product roadmap. And nothing to announce, but the team is certainly active. And then the last category is returning capital to shareholders. You saw us do that last year in the third quarter, about $600 million to purchase 5% of our outstanding shares. And so, we are deploying capital kind of across all three. In terms of hurdle rates, you'd expect us to use our cost-of-capital at least, and we are mindful of that. And nothing further to update you now on capital allocation. It was something that we're kind of constantly looking at.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of John Todaro with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
John Todaro: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question. And yeah, great results here. I guess just trying to understand...
Jason Warnick: Hey, John.
John Todaro: ...yeah, of course, the crypto side of the business post the Wells notice and just kind of get a little bit more color on where you're thinking at. And I guess in particular, if you look at it and you go, ""Hey, we're kind of almost being treated the same way as Coinbase,"" does it start to make sense where you look at more broader listings because you guys have been fairly conservative on that front? Or is that not really a fair way to think about it?
Vlad Tenev: Yeah. I think you're right in that. We've been extremely selective about the assets that we offer on the platform. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we have seen increases in volumes and in market share on the crypto side. I think for a long time, we were offering customers great pricing on purchasing crypto assets, but we weren't doing a great job of communicating it. And now we are communicating it through the user interface and through all sorts of marketing surfaces. And I think customers are starting to pick up on that fact. You're seeing it talked about more in social media, just how great of a deal they're getting on crypto transactions. And we're expanding in the EU where we again believe that we can provide great service and great offerings to customers. So, the crypto team has been working tremendously hard. The roadmap there is quite full. There's a lot to do to make the products experience better for customers.
Jason Warnick: And I would just add that we've been incredibly selective in the coins that we've listed and are confident that the coin selection does not include any better securities and we continue to apply that high standard on anything that we would list on our platform.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brian Bedell: All right. Great. Thanks. Good evening. Maybe just staying on the crypto theme, maybe Vlad and Jason, if you can talk about just the nature of the surge in crypto volumes in March? And I think you said April was at $10 billion. I appreciate, of course, this is very volatile class, but maybe if you can just talk about what you're seeing that drove that heavy activity in March, and whether you think we could see spikes like that again? And then just the mix of crypto volumes between the EU and U.S. is -- maybe the EU is still very small, but just trying to get a sense of that.
Vlad Tenev: Yeah. I mean in terms of what drives crypto volumes, I think modulo our market share gains, our crypto activity does track the broader market. And I don't really want to get into prognosticating what the crypto market is going to do. That's obviously a difficult thing for anyone to do. It's a global market. There have been ETFs approved, as you all know. And that's why we look at market share and how we're doing relative to peers, because markets go up and down, but if our market share is growing throughout all conditions, then over the long run, we'll do very, very well on that side of the business. And that's kind of our approach across all of the asset classes for the active trader business. But the goal is also to diversify the business so that we're sort of like less reliant on volumes anywhere, in any one category to drive business results. I think that's kind of what you're starting to see in this quarter's results is really the performance of the company across all asset classes and even across wallet share with the net deposit growth numbers.
Jason Warnick: In terms of the mix element of your question on Europe, you're right, it's still a relatively modest contribution, the lion's share came from our U.S. crypto business, but we like what we're seeing, and tens of thousands of customers there. So, we'll continue investing there.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Patrick Moley: Yes, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. So I just had one on index options. I see it's referenced in the deck, but I didn't hear mentioned in the prepared remarks. So, are you still planning to roll out index options later this year? And then just on the economics, it's my understanding that index options are much less profitable for the brokers than multi-listed options are. So just curious if -- what your expectations are around how much of your current options trading could be cannibalized by index options? And if you do, or when you do roll it out, have you given any thought to potentially charging a commission on index options? Thanks.
Vlad Tenev: Yeah. So, we have announced that we are going to be launching index options. This is part of the overall goal of giving our active traders access to the best tools and the best value for their services. So, index options are coming in Q4. We'll also be launching Futures as we've mentioned in the past. And as with any new Robinhood product, there's two areas where we'd like to stand out in the broader marketplace. One is the user experience. We want to make sure that our tools are easy for active traders to use, particularly on mobile, but also on web with the new offering that's coming there. And then economics. So, yeah, the economics, we intend to make very, very competitive, but also profitable for the company on a segment basis. So, Jason, I don't know if you want to add anything more specific there.
Jason Warnick: Yeah, we're still working with the team on the pricing structure for index options. So, we'll have to stay tuned there. But agree with Vlad that we want it to be a great value for customers and also make a lot of sense for us economically.
Vlad Tenev: And we should note index options trade round the clock, which is one of the reasons why they become so popular. So, we don't anticipate seeing a ton of cannibalization there.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Neill with FT Partners. Your line is open.
Matthew O'Neill: Yes. Hi guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. A lot of good ones asked and answered already. I was wondering though since you are seeing such a clear inflection point in the MAUs and you gave some incremental details around the growth there from card, both Gold and non-Gold sounds like 0.5 million each, could you help parse maybe the rest of the monthly active user growth even just anecdotally like more crypto-focused or more options and equity-focused? Thanks.
Jason Warnick: Yeah, absolutely. There is an impact to MAUs when crypto interest surges and we saw that in the quarter. And so that's certainly a part of it. But when I look at the activity across the quarter, it was very broad-based; equities up, options activity up, certainly crypto retirement, Gold members, net deposits. And so, we really saw an overall lift that was reflected in the engagement numbers that you're seeing.
Matthew O'Neill: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Ken Worthington: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. When we look at your promotions...
Vlad Tenev: Hi, Ken.
Ken Worthington: Hi. When we look at your promotions, they seem focused on gathering additional customer assets. Do you think such asset-focused promotions could endure over the intermediate term or even longer term as a business strategy? Any reasons why the competition might not either be able to or just might not follow you with promotions of their own? And as we think about other behaviors you want to target, are there others that promotions might make sense for you to target at some point in the future?
Vlad Tenev: Yeah. I can start with that. I think the first thing I should note is we've invested in building a strong data science and product analytics capability from inception in the company. And I think that's starting to become a key differentiator now that AI is becoming more and more important, and now that we've started running these promotions, we look at it very closely. We can track them all sorts of ways across cohorts and different types of customer behavior. And we like what we're seeing. I think Jason mentioned earlier in the call that for the 1% matches, we've been targeting a sub-one-year payback and that's between two and three years for the 3% promotions, and the cohorts from 2023 have already paid back with 2024 looking good as well. So, we feel really good about the offering and you should see more creativity from the team going forward. I don't think that we've fully excavated what we can do with this capability that we've built.
Jason Warnick: Yeah, Ken, we love that we're taking share. We love that we're winning assets against the incumbents. And in terms of your question about how durable it is in the medium to longer term, I don't see any reason with our highly scalable platform that we can't continue to offer promotions like that, especially with the attractive paybacks that we're realizing. On your question about whether it's something that could be copied by competitors, I think we could all come up with a handful of reasons why it would be challenging for them, whether it's their cost structure or just their installed base, and defending that through a promotion like that. But we love the promotions here at Robinhood. And again, we like that we are taking share.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Your line is open.
Benjamin Budish: Hi, good evening, and thanks for taking the question. Just on the topic of competition, you highlighted that 25% of net transfers came from other brokerages. Can you just talk about like this customer cohort, how do they compare to your pre-existing customer base? Are they coming -- are you seeing any behaviors? Are they coming for the high savings rate? Are they coming for the deposit bonus? Are they active traders? Are they engaging in crypto? Like any kind of characteristics of this cohort, are they similar or different from sort of like the existing customer base? Thank you.
Vlad Tenev: Yeah. They're probably more similar than different. One of the things that I'd highlight is they're coming in with average balances that are much higher than our typical historical customers. So, loving the quality of the assets being brought and the activity of the customers. And it's really reflected too in the comments that we are making about payback periods on these promotions that we are seeing customers engage with our products in a way that generates revenue for us.
Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Vlad for closing remarks.
Vlad Tenev: All right. Thank you guys for all the questions. And look, we love the quarter. We love where the business is heading. I think that long-term, we are really positioning Robinhood to be a generational company that will benefit from a generational wealth transfer that is only starting now from older generations to Gen X and Millennials. And the goal over the long run is for all of our customers, all of their assets should be custodied at Robinhood and all of their financial transactions should go through Robinhood. And I think you're starting to see us make significant progress towards that. So, thank you for being with us on the call and on the journey.

2024,Q2,2024-08-07,"Operator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to Robinhood Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, it will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Chris Koegel, VP of Corporate FP&A and Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.
Chris Koegel : Thank you, Lateef, And thank you to everyone for joining Robinhood's Q2 Earnings Call. With us today are CEO and Co-Founder, Vlad Tenev and CFO, Jason Warnick. Before getting started, I just want to remind you that today's call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations, and we have no duty to provide updates unless legally required. Potential risk factors that could cause differences, including regulatory developments that we continue to monitor are described in the press release we issued today, the earnings presentation, and our SEC filings, all of which can be found at investors.robinhood.com. Today's discussion will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the GAAP results we consider most comparable can be found in the earnings presentation. With that, let me turn it over to Vlad.
Vlad Tenev : Thanks, Chris. Hi, everyone. Let me start with the three things Robinhood is focused on. Number 1, winning the active trader market. Number 2, increasing wallet share with our customers. And number 3, expanding internationally. We are making progress across all three of these. And in Q2, we delivered another quarter of strong outcomes and several financial records. More specifically, our retail trading market share continued to increase, leading to year-over-year growth in equity option and crypto volumes. Net deposits were a new record of $13 billion in the quarter, translating to a 41% annualized growth rate. With $11 billion in Q1, we've already exceeded our long-term annual target of 20% plus, and we're only halfway through the year. Gold subscribers reached a record 2 million, which is over 60% year-over-year growth, and now over 8% of funded customers are gold members. And these results, combined with continued expense discipline, drove 40% year-over-year revenue growth to a record $682 million as well as record EPS of $0.21. There's still so much to do, so we're not slowing down. On the active trader front, we've been consistently growing our market share among equities and options, but until recently, one area where candidly our progress has not been so great is margin. And this is a huge opportunity for us as brokerage incumbents generate far more revenue on margin than even trading. In particular, we were not getting much adoption from customers with larger margin balances because our rates were not very competitive. So we introduced industry leading rates for active traders in May. And this, coupled with the continued improvements we are making to the accounts transfers flow, led margin balances to grow by over 20% in the last five weeks of the quarter to a two-year high of $5 billion. Now 75% of that growth came from customers with margin balances over $100,000. So we're really pleased with the progress we're making on margin with our large active customers. And we're continuing to see strong margin balance growth in Q3. Finally, we're nowhere close to being done building for active traders. There's plenty more coming, including our inaugural Hood Summit in October. We have a lot of positive feedback from our gold event in March. So we decided to host a special event just for our active traders. And this will be much bigger than the gold event. We'll be launching some awesome new products that we can't wait to tell you about. Now, let me turn it over to Jason to review our financial results, and then I'll offer some additional thoughts.
Jason Warnick : Thanks, Vlad. It's good to speak with everyone today. As we discussed last quarter, we are focused on driving another year of profitable growth and in Q2 we continue to make good progress. We drove new highs in revenues, adjusted EBITDA, net income, and GAAP EPS in Q2. Compared to a year ago, total net revenues grew 40% to $682 million. Adjusted EBITDA roughly doubled to $301 million. Incremental margins were 77%. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 13 points to 44%, as we make progress over time towards the 50% plus levels comparable to what we see from incumbent brokerage firms. And net income was $188 million, or $0.21 per share, up 7 times from a year ago. And taking a look at the past year, it's great to see how a number of strong quarters came together. For the last 12 months, revenues were over $2.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA was over $800 million, both new highs. We're pleased with these results as we aim to continue delivering profitable growth in 2024. Now let's move to Q2 business results. Assets under custody finished Q2 at a record $140 billion, up 57% year-over-year. A key driver of that asset growth was record Q2 net deposits of over $13 billion, which translates to a 41% annualized growth rate. It's also great to see how assets continue to diversify. Retirement AUC was nearly $9 billion in Q2, more than doubling from last quarter. And cash sweep balances were a record $21 billion in Q2, up 76% year-over-year. We're also driving growth in Robinhood Gold, which continues to deliver value to both our customers and our shareholders. As a reminder, gold subscribers on average are 7 times larger than our customers overall, have been growing net deposits twice as fast, and adopt products at higher rates, leading to gold ARPU that is over 7 times our customer average. In Q2, we grew gold subscribers to 2 million, up over 60% year-over-year. This represents an adoption rate of 8.2% of customers, up from 5.3% a year ago. We are excited to see continued momentum in our gold program, which now includes annualized recurring subscription revenue of over $100 million. Now let's turn to our financial results, starting with Q2 revenues compared to last quarter. Transaction-based revenues were roughly flat as equities and options increased while crypto revenues declined with industry volumes. Net interest revenues grew due to higher securities lending activity and higher interest earning asset balances and other revenues increased driven by proxy seasonality and continued growth in Robinhood gold. Turning the second quarter expenses, combined adjusted OpEx and SBC was $493 million in Q2, this includes increased employee bonus accruals given the strong start we've had to the year, as well as some costs related to our two recently announced acquisitions, Bitstamp and Pluto. All in, through the first half of the year, our expenses are on track with the middle of our full year outlook range of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion. So we're keeping our outlook unchanged and we'll continue actively managing our expenses based on the returns we see on our growth investments, as well as the macro environment. Before I pass the call back to Vlad, I want to share some perspectives about how we are thinking about capital deployment. When we think about capital allocation, our primary objective is to maximize earnings and free cash flow per share over time. We do this by allocating capital to organic growth and M&A to drive earnings and free cash flow higher. And we complement that with share repurchases that can increase the value per share. And in Q2, we made good progress. First, we continued to invest in organic growth in areas like product development, marketing, and customer matches. We have a lot of momentum and I like the economics we're driving. Second, we announced two acquisitions. In June, we signed an agreement to acquire Bitstamp, a global crypto exchange. We believe it will accelerate our crypto roadmap, enabling us to serve a broader user base, enhance our capabilities, and provide additional liquidity for crypto trading. Additionally, we acquired Pluto to help us move even faster in AI and advisory. We're excited to share more as we make progress here. And finally, we announced a $1 billion share repurchase authorization, which we started executing in July and currently expect to execute over a two year to three year period. This timeline could vary depending on market conditions and other capital allocation opportunities. Looking ahead, we believe we are well positioned to drive higher earnings and free cash flow per share over time, driven by our 20% plus [net deposit] (ph) growth, naturally hedged business model, and 90% fixed cost base. And we have a lot of momentum entering the second half of the year, as our business is having a great start to Q3. As context, June was a strong month with nearly record options volume, close to a 24-month high for equities volume, and over $4 billion of net deposits. And in July, trading volumes were more than 20% higher than June across equities, options, and crypto. And net deposits were again over $4 billion. While August is just getting started, so far it looks a lot like July, including over $1 billion of net deposits in the first week of August. With that, I'll turn the call back to Vlad.
Vlad Tenev : Thanks Jason. As I said earlier, the second part of our strategy is increasing wallet share with customers, including growing Robinhood Gold subscriptions, which hit an all-time high in Q2. And we've been busy rolling out additional value for Robinhood Gold customers, including a 1% unlimited deposit boost and a new Gold credit card with 3% cash back. Now I've talked before about how we've been seeing the flywheel accelerate and I thought I would explain in a little bit more detail how it works. So here it goes. First, our gold members receive industry leading economics in a world-class customer experience across all of our products and services. This leads to double the net deposit growth and higher multi-product adoption, including retirement adoption that's five times that of average customers. And as the flywheel spins, it leads to greater customer loyalty and ARPU that's over 7 times that of our average customer. And this leads to faster gold member growth at a better ROI. The different components of the flywheel are self-reinforcing, leading to higher customer satisfaction, higher revenues, and greater diversification for our business over time. So we had a strong Q2, and you should know our team's been working incredibly hard to deliver even more value to our customers. Roadmap is full, there is so much to do, now let's move to questions.
A - Chris Koegel: Thank you, Vlad. For the Q&A session, we'll start by answering the top few shareholder questions from Say Technologies ranked by number of votes. We passed over questions that have already been answered on this call or in prior quarters and grouped together questions that shared a common theme. After the Say questions, we'll turn to live questions from our analysts. So I'll kick it off with our first question from Say. The first question is, When are you rolling out the credit cards?
Vlad Tenev: Thank you. And thanks to Chandler, the question asker. So we started rolling out the credit card a few months ago, and we recently announced that we have crossed 50,000 cardholders. And we recognize the demand for the credit card is high. And the feedback that we've gotten so far from customers is also very, very positive. People love the card, customers love the rewards. They love everything about it, the in-app experience, the digital experience, the card itself. The app so far has a 5.0 Rating on the App Store with over 7,000 reviews. So there is a lot of demand to roll it out faster. Just to set the context, if you compare the rollout of our credit card with other successful card programs in the past, we are kind of right on track, rolling it out at the same rate roughly in Year 1. And these programs tend to start off a little bit more slowly as the unit economics are validated and the customer activity around borrowing and spending is validated as well. So we recognize that there is a ton of demand. Part of that is also because people are seeing the card in the wild and seeing the positive reviews. And we want to build that demand, but we're going to be prudent and make sure we do it while carefully managing the risks of any new business.
Chris Koegel: Right. Thank you, Vlad. The next question asks, can we get more information on the AI company that you just acquired?
Vlad Tenev: Yes, absolutely. I will take this one as well. We're really excited about Pluto. They're an AI-powered investment research platform, and the team is really, really great. And in terms of what we plan to do with the team and the technology, we think they can help us accelerate the work we are doing both in AI and in advisory. And we have got some really good stuff in the works there. So stay tuned.
Chris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Vlad. And then the last question from Say. Do you ever plan on releasing a desktop version of Robinhood with more in-depth chart analysis capabilities?
Vlad Tenev: Yes. As a matter of fact, this is one of the top things that we've been focused on this year. And we've been actually we've been actually making sure that the platform is very, very good. I've seen some demos of it and the demos are looking great. And I think it is going to be an amazing product that customers will love. So stay tuned. We can't wait to share it with you guys.
Chris Koegel: All right. Thanks, Vlad. That concludes our shareholder questions from Say Technologies. We appreciate our shareholders taking time to ask these questions to Vlad and Jason and look forward to more next quarter. Now I will turn the call back over to Latif to lead Q&A from our analysts.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Dolev of Mizuho.
Dan Dolev: Hi, Vlad. Hi guys. Really good results here. Really amazing results here as always. I want to know about all the growth you are seeing in the 24 hour markets and can you give me some color on the outage from earlier this week because we've got a lot of questions about it? Thank you and great stuff.
Vlad Tenev: Yes, yes. I will field that one. And thank you, Dan. So about 24-hour market, I first want to say that with this product, we are on the bleeding edge of technology in trading, this product is not commonly available with such a large instrument base to customers. And with any new product, there is some -- sometimes things don't go exactly right. In this particular case, the third-party ATS that we route orders to, which is called Blue Ocean ATS, had some technology issues, they couldn't handle the extreme demand this Sunday. And they had to shut down, and this is disappointing for customers. I mean we've had our share of scaling pains in the past. This time, it is a third-party, which is nonetheless, very, very frustrating. But we've been working with the team over at Blue Ocean, making sure that we are being as helpful as possible in them scaling their infrastructure, helping them with testing and we are confident that they’ve a testing and scaling plan in place that will allow us to release this product safely and handle much larger load across all the symbols we offer. And I think that is planning to be instituted over -- in the next week or so. I should also mention, 24-hour market has been incredibly successful, and that's partly the cause of all this attention. We are nearing $30 billion in volumes since launch in the overnight hours, and we are really excited because this product is one of the reasons why we believe that customers would be advantaged on Robinhood and they would have access that they wouldn't have on other platforms. So we are going to continue to invest in it. As with any product on the bleeding edge of innovation, you should expect the reliability and the quality to improve consistently over time. And we're going to make sure we continue to work with our partners, including Blue Ocean so that we can deliver that for you all.
Dan Dolev: Amazing momentum. Thanks again.
Vlad Tenev : Thanks Dan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, Steven.
Steven Chubak: Vlad, Jason, and Chris, good afternoon. Hope you are well? I wanted to start off with a question just on a bigger picture one, the crypto strategy. There's been some speculation that we could get some improved regulatory clarity on the crypto side, especially with the change in administration. I was just hoping you could speak to the incremental revenue opportunity or how the strategy might evolve from expanding your crypto offering, whether it is adding additional coins, staking or lending? And specific to the quarter, what drove the higher crypto take rate in 2Q?
Jason Warnick: I'll go ahead and start. It is Jason here, and Vlad can contribute with his thoughts as well. So in terms of what the implications would be of improved regulatory environment for crypto, I think what that would do is really allow us to innovate more rapidly and bring more to market what customers would like to see in crypto. And in the current situation, we are able to do that more in the EU than we are in the US. And I know that can be frustrating for our customers. And so I think you hit on some of the top things. We'd be able to offer more coins. And certainly, there's a wide selection of coins that because of the regulatory environment, we're not comfortable listing today. We'd also be able to innovate in new products and services, things like lending and taking and bring that to market. So in terms of the revenue opportunity, I mean I think for tokens, you could just estimate looking at share of market and overall industry volumes as they are traded in other platforms here in the US and abroad, as well as the other services that we don't yet offer. So I think it could be meaningful, and we are continuing to work with our regulators to gain that clarity.
Vlad Tenev: Yes. And I would just add that, of course, clarity is good and we believe the US needs to be a leader in crypto, and we will get the clarity here in the domestic market. We haven't felt constrained by this with regard to our crypto business. We've been really happy at the speed of execution and innovation. Of course, we built a system that offers different products, Solana staking, more asset selection in the EU. In the US, there is plenty of work to do, and we believe we can be successful regardless of what administration ultimately ends up taking power in November or if it's the same one. We've done a lot of work to innovate on pricing. And you've seen year-over-year increases in market share and volumes of our crypto business as well. So there's plenty of work to do.
Jason Warnick: The second part of your question, Steven was around take rates. And so in the quarter, the crypto take rate was 38 bps. That's up 3 bps quarter-over-quarter. That's really due to pricing experiments. Looking at Q3 and July, the crypto take rates were in the low $0.40 range. And we'll see how we go from there. But we continue to offer great pricing to customers and are excited to see how the quarter plays out.
Steven Chubak: That's great color. And if I could just squeeze in one more just on the rate outlook. Fed futures, now pricing in four additional cuts, since the last earnings call. It might be helpful if you could just speak to the sensitivity to rate cuts or provide an update. But also what are some of the potential offsets that you envisage on the revenue side that could help mitigate some of that pressure on [NII] (ph)?
Jason Warnick: Sure. I'll take that one. So first of all, we've got a lot of experience operating in different rate environments, high rate environments, low rate environments. One thing that we really like about our business is the natural offset between rates and trading. So as rates fall, asset values and trading tend to increase. And overall, lower rates tend to be a tailwind for growth for our business. I think there is a couple of important things to call out. First, we've been growing our interest-earning assets at a really nice pace. But not all of our interest earning assets are sensitive to rate changes. So actually, over half of the balance of interest earning assets relates to our cash sweep and the spread we earn there is relatively fixed, which minimizes the impact of changes in rates. Second, we are broadening the way that we serve our customers. And that’s leading to a much more diversified business for us. Specific to the question you asked about what the rate impact is, so assuming a 25 basis point change or decline that would affect NIM by $40 million. And hard to predict the exact timing, but we feel good about the natural hedge. We have $1 billion of transaction-based revenue, and it takes a relatively small uptick in trading activity to offset that decline in interest.
Steven Chubak : That’s great color. Thanks so much for taking my questions.
Jason Warnick : You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America.
Craig Siegenthaler: Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you're all doing well. So my question is on big picture organic growth. This was the second quarter in a row that your total organic growth has exceeded 40% annualized. Now there's a lot of drivers in there like the matching efforts but some of your initiatives like the UK brokerage and Europe crypto are very early innings. So we wanted to get your potential -- your thoughts on the potential organic growth rate in the second half just given all the moving pieces. So is 40% sustainable?
Jason Warnick: So we have a long track record of 20% plus organic growth rate, and we have a really strong first half of the year, as you pointed out. I think what I can say that would be helpful here is that that's continuing so far into Q3. We are seeing an incredibly strong July with activity across the three trading categories up 20% over the June levels, and we are seeing that continue in August. So over $4 billion of net deposits in July and over $1 billion in the first week of August. So all signs at this point in the quarter are showing that our customers continue to engage with us, continue to deposit their money with us. And I think as Vlad mentioned, we now have eight businesses where the annualized revenue run rate is over $100 million. And so we are much more diversified today than we were even just a couple of years ago, and I think very well positioned, especially as we continue innovating for customers and rolling out new products. to continue driving outsized organic growth.
Vlad Tenev: And I just want to emphasize one other thing I mentioned earlier in the remarks which is that we haven't really taken the lid off of the new active trader products. Our active trader business is the most mature and investments that we make there have the most immediate impact on our business, relative to our investments growing wallet share and also internationally. And we've got an event for our active traders in October, where we are going to unveil some new products. And I think we are getting very, very excited about it. So those results that you are seeing, I mean there -- they're good results. We're proud of them, but I think we have plenty of room to run on the active trader side, and that includes margin, but it also includes new product innovations that we've been [baking] (ph) for the majority of the year.
Craig Siegenthaler: Vlad. that's great to hear. On the innovation side, I think there's still a few product gaps versus some of the more established online brokers. And I'm thinking like custody mutual funds fixed income products, CDs. Now you do have ACAT functionality now and I think that helps. But can you provide us an update on some of the near-term product gaps that you can fill?
Vlad Tenev: Yes. Well, what I'll tell you is that on the active trader front, we've talked a lot about futures. We've talked a lot about how we're great on mobile, but there's a lot of existing customers that need the more power of a web interface and a desktop interface. So they can take advantage of extra screen real estate and use better tools and charting. So those are gaps in a way, but also opportunities for us to really differentiate and innovate and jump ahead of what we've seen elsewhere. I think regarding more sort of like passive buy-and-hold assets like CDs and mutual funds, we are climbing the capability curve with our ACAT transfers product and we made a ton of progress just this year, making the process of moving assets into Robinhood as easy as possible. I think that's really led to some of the bottom-line results that you're seeing, including net positive account transfers from every major incumbent brokerage firm for several quarters running now. And the goal would be to actually accelerate that over time. We see plenty of opportunity we want to remove reasons that customers have for withdrawing, and we think we can systematically reduce reasons for withdrawals over the long run and also increased reasons for customers to deposit. And so this is one thing we're really focused on, and it's going to take some time to play out. But I think you should see that reflect over the long run and increased net deposit activity. We're going to go through and add all of the assets that are missing. We are going to add all the capabilities and then we’re going to make sure the process of transferring is better at Robinhood than anywhere else. And then the incentives that we offer because of our economics are just kind of the cherry on top that I think will really accelerate asset growth into the platform. So I’m getting – there’s so much to do here and we’re just at the beginning. And we only started offering incoming ACATs in the past couple of years, and we’ve already made a ton of progress here.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan of Citizens JMP.
Devin Ryan: Hi good afternoon Vlad, Jason. Great quarter. Question, would love to just dig in a little bit around how you guys are thinking about the incremental margin potential from here over the intermediate term. So obviously already at a mid-40% EBITDA margin, 90% of the current expense base is fixed. And I know 50% plus is the objective, but you really aren't that far away from 50%. So just love to think about like what the ceiling looks like here? Is there one because you have such an efficient tech stack infrastructure? And then is there anything on the road map that could drive a material acceleration in fixed expenses from the core base? I'm just trying to think about kind of where we could go, I know what the targets are, but just the algorithm? Thanks.
Jason Warnick: Yes. I view kind of the 50%, Devin, is more of a way station on our path to the longer-term margins. You've seen us drive substantial incremental margins over the last few years. This quarter it was 77%. And it's really a reflection of us driving up revenue and managing our costs closely. I think a good analogy to how we're thinking about cost long term is looking at what we did in 2024. We looked at our existing businesses and held those businesses to a low single digit and in some cases, negative OpEx growth rate. And we use those savings to help fund specific growth investments for the business. And there are many that we've been talking about and alluding to on this call, and we set aside an extra $100 million in marketing budget. And all of that translated to operating expense guidance that was up 5% at the midpoint, which we continue to reiterate. And so I think we have a lot of opportunity to see continuing leverage in our existing business. And then you are going to see us on top of that, continue to make very targeted high expected ROI investments for growth. In terms of things that are out there on the road map, it's too early to give specific guidance. The one thing I'd point to is we are rolling out a credit card. And as Vlad talked about, we are being very patient in the short term in the way that we approach that, but that will certainly be some incremental investments next year. But well, stay tuned for a specific guidance on next year.
Vlad Tenev: Yes. The only thing that I would add to that, which I think is interesting is I think we've talked a lot -- you hear a lot about AI and the impact on different sorts of companies. I think one area that we maybe haven't emphasized as much is how we've been making use of that operationally, including for engineering. And as we look at kind of the core engine of our business, we are creating software, we're rolling out products to companies and our business even though we're in financial services, is technology at its core. And we've seen a lot of impact in applying these AI tools on the engineering side, just making different parts of software development process easier and simpler. That's an area we're investing a lot in. And I think there is a lot of room to run. We've already seen significant productivity gains in the past year, and we think we're just -- we're closer to the beginning than to the maturation point of that cycle.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley of Piper Sandler.
Patrick Moley : Yeah, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. So I had one on the Gold offering. You've added a number of things over the last few quarters. You're planning to add more before the end of the year with the web-based platform and options and futures trading or index options and futures trading, rather. Just talk to us about your thoughts on pricing here. You're at $5 a month now. What's the appetite to go higher? And how do you kind of balance that pricing dynamic with your desire to kind of continue to grow that subscriber base? Thanks.
Jason Warnick: Yes, I'll go ahead and take this one. What I'd say is our focus right now is increasing the adoption rate of our customers in gold, and we are doing that by just continuing to invest in the Gold program and we love the economics. I mean it is great that we have the subscription revenue that's north of $100 million annually, but it leads to downstream effects, higher adoption faster net deposits and 7 times the ARPU. And so we are not feeling pressured in the short term to raise the price. It is something that we will continue to look at. And we don't have religion that we wouldn't touch the price over time. But right now, it's not the top priority.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt of KBW.
Kyle Voigt : Hi, good evening. Maybe a question on margin balances. So you know that the impact of cutting your margin rates and the subsequent margin balance growth of 20%. I guess is there any way you can disaggregate how much of that growth is coming from existing Robinhood margin clients simply utilizing margin more versus maybe customers where you know they were utilizing margin elsewhere and has simply transferred or switch that activity to Robinhood? And if there is some of that switching that's happening, can you comment on if the customer margin inflows have generally been from one firm or broad-based for retail brokers across the industry?
Jason Warnick: Yes. I'll go ahead and take this. So it's mostly from existing customers, but we are seeing both existing as well as new customers take advantage of the lower margin rates. And we continue to see this grow in July. We talk about one of our top three strategic pillars is to be Number #1 in active trading. And as Vlad mentioned, we've made a lot of progress on market share for both equities and options and overall or number two, in active trading for those categories for trading, but we are a distant fifth in market share in margins. So it’s a huge opportunity for us. We just lowered the rates in May, and we saw the 20% move to the end of the quarter, that’s continuing in July. And we think that this is a really big opportunity, and we’re definitely starting to take share there. We grew much faster than our peers in the second quarter, even with the May change in the rates.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley.
Mike Cyprys : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to ask for a little bit more color and update on the international expansion efforts, in particular in the UK, in Europe and around the world. Just curious what sort of traction you're seeing so far what steps are you looking to take here in the second half and into 2025 in order to accelerate growth? And as you think about and look around building out the platform overseas, just curious what challenges you face versus having built out the business in the US, and how you are looking to overcome some of those hurdles? Thank you.
Vlad Tenev: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll field that. In a nutshell, we like the early signs that we are seeing. So far, account balances overseas are a little bit smaller than the US on average, but the trading characteristics are pretty similar. And what we really like is as we hear from customers, both in the UK for brokerage and in the EU for crypto, they want things that we offer in the U.S. So UK customers are requesting margin and options and EU customers are requesting the ability to trade stocks. So that I think, validates in part our strategy of expanding with one unified platform internationally. And having the same technology be available in as many markets worldwide as possible. So our focus really is rounding out the feature set in the UK and in the EU, making sure that all of the great products that we have available in the US can be made available there. And that involves working with the relevant regulators in these jurisdictions, taking them along and giving their customers access to all of these awesome products, we feel really, really good about that. And then simultaneously, we are looking into expanding to other jurisdictions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Todaro of Needham.
John Todaro: Hi guys. Congrats on the quarter results here. I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the [bps stance] (ph). They offer a number of crypto offerings and then also the trading payers. This first part of that is, do you anticipate growing products with that acquisition in the US? Or are you still a little bit hamstrung on regulation that is the deciding factor? And then just two within that, Bitstamp historically has had higher trading fees than hud? Do you think those fees on the platform could kind of go higher as we saw take rate going higher here? Or should we not read into that same piece?
Vlad Tenev: I think there's two interesting things about the Bitstamp acquisition that you should know. One of them is international. The second one is institutional the business is a global business. It operates in a lot of jurisdictions, and we could see that accelerating our international expansion on the crypto side, significantly. And also dovetailing quite nicely with the large retail business that we currently have at Robinhood and the great product innovation that we're driving there. The other thing we are excited about is institutional business, and they have great relationships with institutions. It is an area that we believe we are well positioned to tackle because we've built great technology for consumers and institutions also want low cost for market access to crypto. And so we are really excited about the acquisition and working really closely with the team and making our joint products better and better. And I wouldn't over-index on their fee structure at this point. I'd tell you, philosophically, we want to be the market share leader, and we want to offer really competitive rates to customers. And that's kind of the North Star that Robinhood operates under. We'd rather offer low fees and due to our investments in technology and infrastructure, operate at larger scale than our competitors. So you should see us continuing to be aggressive there. But we don't have any specific -- I think it's premature to talk about like the specific changes to the fee structure at this point.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen of Citi.
Chris Allen: Thanks for taking the question guys. I want to dig in a little bit on SEC lending, if possible. Seeing some really nice growth in the customers enrolled and the soft custody enrolled. And just maybe talk about the outlook here. Are you seeing customers enrolled putting more money to work here? Are you seeing just the momentum pick up? And just during the quarter, was there any -- how would you frame the environment from a sec lending perspective because a little slower at some of your competitors out there?
Jason Warnick: Sure. I’ll go ahead and take that. I mean the primary inputs to the business are signing up more customers, and we saw a really nice pickup there, about 400,000 customers joined the program. In the quarter and the assets that are enrolled, and that increased by a little over $6 billion. So really strong inputs into the business. I thought the trading desk did a really nice job. The other input is just the rates that are available and the specific names that we call specials, where there’s a higher rebate that we’ll earn on lending activity. And we saw some nice attractive returns in the quarter. So I’d say, the inputs and the momentum of growing that program is really strong. Trading desk is just doing a great job, and we’ll have to see how the rest of the year plays out.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Neill of FT Partners.
Matthew O'Neill: Good evening, everybody. Thanks so much for the question. Just wanted to follow up. Really, the only knit to pick here maybe was the monthly active user number, and I fully recognize the importance of that number is probably coming down over time as you diversify in some more products and some are longer term and less frequently used. But just curious if there's anything to call out maybe around crypto activity or otherwise? Thanks.
Vlad Tenev: I'll feel that and then maybe Jason will have some thoughts. What are the reasons we deemphasized monthly active users besides as you mentioned, us investing in all these diversified products like Robinhood Gold, which is a yield-based product and retirement and us not directly monetizing monthly active users yet, like we don't have an advertising business, for instance, is that it's just volatile quarter-to-quarter. And a lot of the monthly active user variation is just driven by what's going on in the crypto market. So since we're so large in retail crypto that can cause meaningful swings in monthly active users quarter-over-quarter. And that's pretty much what you see going on. When the crypto markets are hot, there is a huge immediate spike in monthly active user engagement metrics. But then when crypto cools down, that tends to drop more acutely as well. And I think that's pretty similar to what you'd see across the entire crypto market. I think that's not an idiosyncratic Robinhood phenomenon.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.
Ken Worthington: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I'd love to get a bit more color on how the recent market sell off. has impacted your customers. You gave us some color on trading activity, but margin balances have been growing as you called out, sort of recovering with the market. but then growing with the more competitive market rates that you announced sort of going right into the sell-off. So how did Robinhood customers perform in the sell-off in August, in recent days? And can you distinguish the health of your equity sort of long-only customers given their access to leverage versus those with option capabilities where they can both hedge and speculate with options?
Jason Warnick: Yes, I'll go ahead and take this and Vlad you can add some context. So first of all, customers who are trading options and those that are using leverage tend to be are more advanced customers, and they're using a variety of trading strategies to create returns. The thing that I would point to is that we feel great about offering low price and attractive rates. And the rates that we offer on the margin book as an example, are on average, leading across the industry. And so we feel really good about that. I don't think we've shared any specifics on specific returns that individual customers are having or groups of customers. What I'll tell you is almost every time I look at the daily summary reports, when there is a sell-off our customers are buying or when prices are up, our customers are selling. And that contributes to kind of a pretty attractive return capability for customers.
Vlad Tenev: The only thing that I'd add, Ken, is there is a number of areas that we are focused on, and I outlined them in the call, one of them is being the leader in the active trader market. And I think when the goal there is when people think of Robinhood in the active trader space, they should associate us with being at the frontier of technology and innovation in trading. And I think products like 24-hour market reinforce that -- and we do have work to do, both on the product side and kind of in how we tell the story to move away from sort of this like thought that for novices. The reality is most of our customers are in their 30s, they're definitely adults and they're extremely sophisticated. And we are in a competitive market for serving this very real use case, and we're gaining market share, and it's a big part of the core business. But we also have customers that are coming to us for Robinhood Gold for our high-yield products for our awesome retirement products that has been growing assets very, very tremendously. And they're less interested in trading actively, and that's fine, too. We think that we can be a leader in wallet share, particularly for the millennial generation. And that's something that we're also focused on. There's going to be tens of trillions of assets going from baby boomers down to Gen X and Gen Y and beyond. And we are putting Robinhood in a position to be one of the, if not the primary beneficiary of that long-term shift in assets and that kind of how you're seeing the work we're doing in ACATs, diversifying the business and adding support for different assets. And so we're very excited about that, but we think we can be leaders in both.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Budish of Barclays.
Benjamin Budish: Hi, afternoon and thanks for taking the question. I was wondering maybe following up some your comments there, Vlad, if you could unpack a little bit the growth in options over the course of the year. What are you seeing in terms of like-for-like growth or almost the same unit or same sales, if you will? Are you seeing any stats you can share around the number of customers enabled for options? Or is it sort of the existing base sort of getting more active? And when you talk about market share, clearly your options activity as a percentage of overall industry activity is going up. What about on the customer side, to what degree do you -- the extent are you seeing customers coming to Robinhood for options or how much of the growth is coming from new customers versus increased activity from prior customers? Thank you.
Vlad Tenev: Yes. I mean, the thing I'd tell you and maybe Jason can jump into our options team has been doing a great job. We have one major advantage. I mean, several major advantages relative to what you see elsewhere in the options market. First of all, we don't charge options contract fees. So most of our competitors charge $0.65 a contract, which can add up if you're an active trader. And so purely economic perspective, you're kind of at a disadvantage if you trade options outside of Robinhood, particularly for active traders. The other area is the user experience. And we've built and announced some amazing tools in the past couple of quarters, including option simulated returns which gives people a pretty advanced analytic tool that they previously were downloading other products and paying subscription fees to get. Now that's built in with Robinhood. And we've done awesome improvements to the user experience to make it easier for customers to do the transactions that they want to do. And we've got a lot of remaining work to do. We know a lot of our customers like trading options on desktop where they get additional screen real estate and have the opportunity to do more research on platform. And so we're confident that we can keep growing that market share even further.
Jason Warnick: Yes. I would just say that the number of customers trading options are up about 25% year-over-year.
Vlad Tenev: Yes. The team has really been doing a great job.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Vlad Tenev for closing remarks. Sir?
Chris Koegel : Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for listing. We really appreciate the engagement from shareholders and the analyst community. And also a special shout out to the retail analyst. We have a lot of retail analysts that cover the company as well. Maybe they're not on these calls, but they're on YouTube and on X. We appreciate you all and look out for us on podcasts and other things in the next couple of days where we'll share more about the company.

2024,Q3,2024-10-30,"Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Catherine and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Robinhood Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now like to turn the call over to Chris Koegel, Vice President of Corporate, FP&A and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Chris Koegel : Thank you, Catherine, and thank you to everyone for joining Robinhood's Q3 earnings call. With us today are CEO and co-founder Vlad Tenev and CFO Jason Warnick. Before getting started, I want to remind you that today's call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations, and we have no duty to provide updates unless legally required. Potential risk factors that could cause differences, including regulatory developments that we continue to monitor are described in the press release we issued today, the earnings presentation, and our SEC filings, all of which can be found at investors.robinhood.com. Today's discussion will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the GAAP measures we consider most comparable can be found in the earnings presentation. With that, let me turn it over to Vlad.
Vlad Tenev : Thanks, Chris. Hi, everyone. Let me start by reiterating Robinhood's three areas of focus. Number one, winning the active trader market. Number two, increasing wallet share with our customers. And number three, expanding internationally. In Q3, we continue to make progress on all of these fronts. In fact, our results after the first three quarters of the year have already broken through a number of full-year records. And we have another quarter in front of us to take these results even higher. Just to share a few examples. First, Q3 net deposits were $10 billion or more for the third straight quarter as we continue to increase wallet share. This brings us to $34 billion year-to-date, above our 2020 record of $31 billion, and also takes our customer assets under custody to a record high of $152 billion. Second, Q3 options contracts were up 47% year-over-year to a new record as we keep winning with active traders. This brings our year-to-date total to $1.2 billion contracts, edging out our full-year high from 2021. And third, Q3 was another strong financial quarter with our second highest revenues ever. Revenues grew 36% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA increased 96% from a year ago. Looking year-to-date, revenues of nearly $2 billion have already broken last year's record of $1.9 billion, and GAAP diluted EPS of $0.55 is multiples of any prior year. It's energizing to see our business performing well like this, but we're even more excited about our product roadmap. A key part of increasing wallet share with customers is growing Robinhood Gold subscriptions, which hit an all-time high of $2.2 million in Q3. And one of the most exciting new parts of the Gold program is our Robinhood Gold card. When I've talked to Robinhood customers in recent months, the Gold card almost always comes up. If someone has it, they love it. If they don't have it, they want to know when they're going to get it. And I hear you. We're working hard to increase the rollout, but we're also being patient and carefully studying customer behavior as we grow so that we manage credit risk to profitably scale over time. While it's still early, I wanted to share some emerging data from our 100,000 Gold card customers. First, customers love the Gold card. App store ratings continue to be five out of five with over 10,000 five-star reviews. Customers tell us they love the metal card, the digital app, and of course, the 3% rewards. Second, the early customer behavior is in line with our expectations. It looks like the Gold card is top of wallet for most customers, and early data shows that we're retaining approximately 95% of Gold card customers following their first transaction. We're also starting to see customer spending grow and loan balances revolve as expected. Third, Gold card customers are also contributing meaningfully higher net deposits versus similar customers. It's great to see the early additional benefits to the platform. All in all, while it's still quite early, we're further increasing confidence that we can scale the Gold card significantly over time. Now, let me turn it over to Jason to review our financial results, and then I'll offer some additional thoughts.
Jason Warnick: Thanks, Vlad, and thanks everyone for joining us today. In Q3, we had another strong quarter, growing revenues 36% and driving 77% incremental adjusted EBITDA margins versus a year ago. Q3 business results also set a number of new highs, including assets under custody, options contracts, cash suite balances, and retirement AUC, as well as multi-year highs for equity volumes and margin balances. And as we enter 2024 focused on driving another year of profitable growth, we're excited that we've already broken records for full-year revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and earnings per share. Looking at the progress we made in Q3 versus a year ago. Assets under custody grew 76% to a record $152 billion. Net deposits were $10 billion plus for the third straight quarter and $39 billion over the past year. This translates to annualized net deposit growth rates of 29% in Q3 and 45% over the past year. Total net revenues grew 36% to $637 million. Adjusted EBITDA nearly doubled to $268 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 13 points to 42% and net income grew to $150 million or $0.17 per share. This was reduced by one cent for a regulatory accrual in the quarter. We're pleased with these results which mark our fourth straight quarter of GAAP profitability and ninth straight quarter positive adjusted EBITDA. Now let's look more closely at Q3 revenues which increased year-over-year across all three categories. Transaction based revenues grew 72% as we drove higher volumes and market share gains across all trading products. It was great to see option, equity and crypto volumes up 47%, 65% and over 100% from a year ago respectively. Net interest revenues increased 9% as we grew interest earning assets and securities lending activity improved. This included customers growing their cash suite balances 80% year-over-year and margin balances building to a two year high. Lastly, other revenues grew by 42% as we added over 850,000 gold subscribers in the past year to reach a record 2.2 million subscribers and record annualized recurring gold subscription revenue of over $110 million. I'd also note that our Q3 revenues include the impact of contra revenues from amortizing matches on customer deposits and transfers. Q3 contra revenues were $27 million up $14 million sequentially, mostly driven by the 1% gold deposit boost. We expect contra revenues to grow sequentially by a similar amount in Q4 and then grow much slower in 2025. To provide some more context, customers love the matches we provide on asset transfers and IRA contributions and we're seeing great payback periods on these matches. At the same time, the 1% gold deposit boost has not driven as much incremental customer activity as our other promotions. So we've decided to wind it down in November to focus on offers that resonate more with customers. As an example, we doubled down recently for our hood week promotion by offering a range of matches on asset transfers. And in just two weeks, this led to $2 billion of transfers in from brokerage incumbents that averaged over $130,000 per customer. Stepping back, when we reflect on our revenue so far this year, it feels good that our last three quarters are the three highest in company history. Turning to Q3 expenses, we had another good quarter of expense discipline. Combined adjusted OpEx and SBC was $476 million in Q3 in the middle of our ‘24 outlook range on a quarterly basis. Looking ahead to Q4, we're pleased that we're still on track for our full year outlook range of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion of adjusted OpEx and SBC, even while driving nearly 40% year-over-year revenue growth for the first three quarters of the year. We anticipate we'll likely finish near the top end of that range given our continued growth investments to finish the year strong. Turning to capital management, we started our 1 billion share repurchase program in July. We allocated 97 million to repurchase 5 million shares in Q3 and made good initial progress on our expected two to three year total timeline. We love deploying capital like this. It lowers our share count and positions us to increase EPS and free cash flow per share over time. And when we look at last year's share repurchase, plus the start of our new program, we've deployed over $700 million to repurchase approximately 60 million of our shares, equivalent to about 7% of our current diluted count. And we're continuing to repurchase shares daily in Q4. Before passing it back to Vlad, I'd like to comment on the strong momentum we are seeing so far in October. Net deposits are north of $4 billion, and cash suite balances are more than 25 billion. As for trading, equity notional volumes highest month in over three years. Option contracts look to be one of the highest months ever and crypto notional volumes are over $5 billion on track to exceed the Q3 monthly average. I'd also highlight that our crypto rebates have increased to 48 basis points in October relative to our 44 basis point average in Q3 and 35 basis points at the start of the year strong. Longer term, we're energized by the progress we're making and believe we are well positioned to drive higher earnings and free cash flow per share over time, driven by our 20% plus net deposit growth, diversified business model and 90% fixed cost base. With that, I'll turn the call back to Vlad.
Vlad Tenev : Thanks, Jason. Now, I want to highlight our progress on the first part of our strategy winning with active traders. Two weeks ago, we held our inaugural Hood Summit in Miami. It was really awesome to have over 400 active trader customers together for a few days and we introduced three exciting new products. First, we announced Index Options, which are one of the fastest growing retail products and make up nearly 10% of U.S. retail options contracts. Our customers have been trading them on other platforms to date, so they're excited to bring their trades to Robinhood and leverage our industry-leading pricing and we're excited to expand our addressable market. Second, we announced Futures. Here, we're not only offering industry-leading pricing, but also a great customer experience with our awesome Futures ladder. We continue to believe that Futures can be a nine-figure revenue business for us over time. Also, building out the infrastructure behind Futures has also enabled us to offer event contracts, including our new presidential election market that we launched. It was great to see customers quickly engage with this new product, trading over 10 million contracts in the first full day, and on track to more than double that today. Third, we launched Robinhood Legend, our new state-of-the-art desktop platform, which we built from the bottom up for active traders. It's clear from customer feedback that Legend is really resonating, so we're doubling down on this new domain. The team is hard at work to rapidly ship more functionality for customers. As additional context, while we are number one in mobile trading, that's only half the retail trading market today. The other half is on web, where we haven't meaningfully competed in the past. So launching Legend is doubling our addressable market. We have a lot of momentum in our active trader offering as we close out the year. As I said earlier, Q3 option volumes were up 47% year-over-year to a new record. And Q3 equity volumes also increased, up 65% year-over-year to a three-year high. And this is even before the full rollout of index options Futures and Robinhood Legend. In closing, we had another strong quarter in Q3, and you should know, our team continues to work incredibly hard to deliver even more value to our customers. The roadmap is full, there's so much to do, and we're excited to share a lot more with you at our Investor Day in December. Now, let's move to questions.
A - Chris Koegel : Thank you, Vlad. For the Q&A session, we'll start by answering the top few shareholder questions from Say Technologies, ranked by number of votes. We passed over questions that we already addressed on this call or in prior quarters, and grouped together questions that shared a common theme. After the Say questions, we'll turn to live questions from our analysts. So I'll kick it off with our first question from Say, which is for Vlad. Vlad, when will the Robinhood Gold card be available to all users?
Vlad Tenev : Yeah, thank you for the question. I think that the first thing I want to say is we've really been humbled by the demand we've seen so far for the Gold credit card. The waitlist is close to 2 million, and so far we've rolled it out to about 100,000 customers. And I think if you compare this to how other successful credit card programs that are new have scaled, that's a pretty quick ramp. But of course, we also recognize it's small compared to the waitlist. The waitlist, frankly, exceeded our expectations, and we're working as hard as we can to get it out as quickly as we can. But it's also important for us to make sure we don't incur significant near-term losses. So we have to understand the customer behavior and the economics because the credit card business can get quite big. And also, if we're not careful, that could mean losses. So as I mentioned earlier, we like the behavior we're seeing. And if the behavior we're seeing continues in this way, over the next year we expect to roll the card out to multiples of where we are today.
Chris Koegel : Right. Thank you, Vlad. The next question is also for you. And it asks, are there any plans to introduce a way to send or receive money to other Robinhood users via the Robinhood ecosystem?
Vlad Tenev : Yeah, we've actually experimented with this in the past when we rolled out Robinhood Spending and the Robinhood Cash Card a couple years ago. Now, right now the focus is really on the credit card offering. We're seeing amazing feedback and strong demand for that. So we're focusing on making sure we scale that. But we do anticipate growing our offerings so that anything that you can do on another consumer finance app or product can be done on Robinhood as well. So this is certainly something that we're thinking about.
Chris Koegel : All right. The third question is also on Robinhood Gold. So rate cuts make Robinhood Gold worse each time. How will gold continue to add value to users, and what new benefits is Robinhood planning to add for gold users? Also for Vlad.
Vlad Tenev : Yeah. So the strategy with gold is to deliver an offering that provides customers with exceptional value in every market environment, regardless of whether the rates are increasing or decreasing. You should be able to get tremendous value from Robinhood Gold. Now, some of the value props naturally do well in an increasing rate environment. Cash sweep with high APY is one of them. Other products tend to be more attractive in declining rate environments. And as a matter of fact, at Hood Summit, we recently announced that gold customers will receive differentiated better pricing on a few of the products we announced. So the pricing, while industry-leading across the board is even better on index options and futures for our gold subscribers. So while rates on sweeps may be coming down because of Fed cuts, we're going to keep investing in gold. And for every new product we launch, we ask ourselves, how can we make it even better for our gold subscribers? And as you see, as we continue to roll out new products, gold should get even better and better.
Chris Koegel : Great. Thank you, Vlad. And last one for you Jason. Jason, can you describe the plans for the live tax gain and loss monitoring that you're rolling out?
Jason Warnick: Sure. There's a couple things I'd highlight on tax management. First of all, we recognize it's really important for customers. Just yesterday, we announced a realized P&L tool shipped. So that one's live for customers now. And we also know that tax lot selection in the app is important for customers. And I'm excited to tell you that we have employee beta testing going on right now for tax lots. And the team is pushing hard to get it in the hands of customers really soon.
Vlad Tenev : We think it's really good. Yeah. I think you're going to like it.
Chris Koegel : All right. That concludes our shareholder questions from Say Technologies. We appreciate our shareholders taking the time to ask these questions of Vlad and Jason and the board and more next quarter. So now I'll turn the call over to Catherine to lead Q&A from our analysts.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Craig Siegenthaler: Good afternoon, everyone. Hope everyone's doing well. First, we want to congratulate you on the Legend launch. And I saw there were, I think, a thousand signups in the first 40 seconds, Vlad, post the launch. But what is the level of signups to date and how many of them are incremental signups to the 24.4 million accounts that are Robinhood as of September 30th?
Vlad Tenev : Yeah, I mean, we are still, the product is not quite ungated in the sense that anyone can just access it. So we've been rolling out to multiples of that number, but haven't yet sort of like opened it up to everyone. Early feedback is extremely positive. I mean, I don't know, you guys probably see the level of live streamers and folks on social media has been tremendous. And the team is, I'd say, even more motivated to keep the momentum and make sure the product is better and better because we really feel like we've got something great here.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Dan Dolev: Hey, Vlad. Hey, guys. Great results again. I'm very proud of you.
Vlad Tenev : Thanks, Dan.
Dan Dolev: Yeah, of course. Well-deserved. I was very intrigued with the presidential election market. And I wanted to know, it's got a lot of press and we've been getting a lot of questions on it. So can you give us some color on how it's doing, how creative it is to overall retention? Anything you can tell us about it would be great. Thank you.
Vlad Tenev : Yeah. So first off, we just rolled out to 100% of customers after starting the rollout just this Monday. So huge kudos to the team for that. The path to offer this product was paved really less than 30 days ago. And we really moved quickly to make it available to customers ahead of the election. So to give a little bit of context around this, one of our focus areas is to win the active trader market. And I think really to do that, our approach is that if you're an active trader, using Robinhood should put you in a position, you should really associate Robinhood with being at the forefront of technology and innovation and trading. And I think offering products like these, which you can't really find at many of our competitors is the best way to do that. So feedback is really, really good. You can see on social that it's resonating with customers very, very clearly. But we rolled out to 100% right before the call started. So I think it's a little bit early to tell to give you too much. Other than yesterday, we did about 10 million contracts. That was pre-full rollout. And we've done even more than that already today.
Dan Dolev: Thanks.
Vlad Tenev : We can take the next one.
Operator: Yes, okay. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Patrick Moley: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I just had one on index options and futures trading. Now that you've announced the pricing on those products, I was hoping you could help us better understand the economics there. I know index options carry a relatively high exchange fee. So what do your margins look like in offering those contracts? How much do you expect to make per contract? And then maybe as part of that, your expectation for how much volume is going to come from gold versus non-gold members. And then if I could add a follow on modeling question, it looks like your equity fee capture declined by about 20% sequentially. So any color there on what drove that would be helpful. Thanks.
Jason Warnick: Sure, Patrick. I'll go ahead and take both of those. This is Jason. So just going index options first, the non-gold price will be industry leading at $0.50 per contract and the gold price will be even better at $0.35 per contract. Cash settled index options, as you know, is a really fast growing segment within options. And so we see this as a big opportunity for us to take market share even faster. As context, we have been taking double digit market share for some time now and that's without having this hotter segment offer. Also on fees, like exchange fees, we'll be passing those through to the customers. On futures, non-gold, $0.75 per contract and gold gets an even better deal at $0.50 per contract. We've said that futures over time, based on volumes we've seen at our competitors. We think it could be a nine figure business for us. So big opportunity for us. The second part of your question was equity take rates. There's really two things that affect our take rate on equity. The first is volatility and the second is mix. And what we saw in the quarter was just customers buying more larger, more liquid names.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Brian Bedell: Great. Good evening, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just on the cadence of customer pickup as we move into 4Q. Just on futures and index contracts in terms of what portion of the user base have you rolled the futures out to so far? And what are the maybe rough plans in doing that for the rest of the quarter. And then same on the index options timing of when you expect to roll that. And if I could just sneak one more in on desktop users, good to hear the great feedback. Any observation yet on increased velocity from the folks that are using it so far?
Vlad Tenev : Yeah. I would say that the folks that use the Robinhood Legend product tend to be among our most active. So, the velocity is quite high. That being said, we rolled it out to 1,000 people during the Robinhood Legend keynote and it was the first 1,000 people that sort of like signed into their Robinhood accounts on desktop. And I think we filled the 1,000 slots in 45 seconds. So, those customers were very keen and engaged to try the product. Early feedback is very positive. And I think it's really important to establish a great reputation among active traders because they're networked in a way. They talk to each other, they listen to other active traders and what we've been seeing is really positive signs from the community about Robinhood Legend. But that said, it's not rolled out fully yet, so we don't have the perfect picture of what it's going to look like at 100%, but so far we really like what we're seeing.
Chris Koegel : Timing on futures and index options?
Vlad Tenev : Yeah, timing on index options and futures. So, the first Robinhood derivatives product that rolled out is our presidential election market. Futures Outrights will probably be rolled out in the coming months, but right now the focus of the futures business is really just making sure everything goes as smoothly as possible for the election next week. And then, of course, rolling out Outrights is a top priority. Index options as well coming in the coming months.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with Citizen JMP. Please go ahead.
Devin Ryan: Great. Hi, Vlad. Hi, Jason. How are you?
Vlad Tenev : Great.
Devin Ryan: Want to ask a question just on interest rate sensitivity. So, obviously, we saw the first 50 basis points in Fed cuts. Last quarter, I think you talked about 25 basis points as a $40 million impact and that was just essentially the simple math off of balances at the time and didn't take into consideration potential for accelerating margin utilization or higher SEC lending activity or higher transaction activity, which often happens as rates come down. So, I'd just love to get a sense of whether you're seeing or expecting to see kind of an acceleration in margin, how you would frame the upside in SEC lending. It seems like we're operating at a depressed level. Do you see a lot of upside in a more normal environment? And then are there any other kind of offsetting forces just that we should be thinking about beyond just the simple math of a rate times the balance? Thanks.
Jason Warnick: Yeah, you bet. And the rate times the balance, again, this quarter would be roughly $40 million for each rate cut. On margin, we've been seeing really nice growth in margin balances following the reduction of rates for customers. That's continued into October. So, that's been moving up. We'll share that number with you here in a couple of weeks. In terms of SEC lending, a couple of dynamics going on there. First, on just the business inputs themselves, we had about 400,000 additional customers join the program this year and several billion in equities added to the program, which is great for the long-term viability of that program. At the same time, we saw rates on specials that we get hard to borrows, come down a bit versus Q2. And I think that's really what you're seeing. But in terms of the underlying business drivers, we feel really good about that. And then lastly, we've talked about for some time about how we think we have a naturally hedged business model that as rates come down, we see interest rates turn into a tail wind for the business around growth. I think you've already started to see some of that with the trading activity, options at an all-time high in Q3, equities hitting a multi-year high. So, I'm feeling even more confident about the tailwinds that come from falling rates. And we'll just have to see how it plays out from here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Please go ahead. You might be on mute, Benjamin.
Benjamin Budish: Hi, sorry. This is Ben. Can you hear me?
Vlad Tenev : Yes. We can hear you now.
Benjamin Budish: Hey, sorry about that. I had the phone stuck on mute. Well, thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk kind of generally about your path to product kind of innovation and launch. It looks like with the active trader offering, the credit card, you're being very kind of cautious and measured in terms of the rollout. How should we read that into future product development? I think we're all expecting a lot to be announced at the December Investor Day. You've talked about broader ambitions in crypto, global kind of brokerage offerings. So yeah, could you talk about sort of your approach to product velocity and how we should think about the pace of rollout for current and future product launches? Thank you.
Vlad Tenev : Yeah. I think that it really depends on the product we're talking about. I mean, for example, just this week with presidential election market, we started the rollout on Monday and completed it on Wednesday, which is very quick particularly for a new product. Credit card is a little bit of a different animal. I mean, nothing technological is preventing us from rolling that out. It's just really looking at other successful credit card programs in the past and making sure that with a wait list of 2 million customers that business could get quite big. But if we don't manage it carefully, losses could get big as well. So to avoid that, we want to make sure we prudently scale it. And so far, we've onboarded about 100,000 customers who love it and early signs are good. And that's roughly in line with how fast other successful card programs have scaled in kind of like the first year of operations. So that one, it's just us making sure that we're understanding customer behavior, understanding credit, since that's a new business for us. And we're feeling good. But yeah, we recognize the demand is extreme. So we're working to onboard people as quickly as possible. And we expect to get to multiples of our current level over the next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Todaro with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.
John Todaro: Hey, Vlad, Jason, thanks for taking the question. I guess just going back to the futures index offerings, any expenses down the road that we should be thinking about increasing on the back of that? I don't recall if we got to kind of that margin of where it should shake out. And then also just what drove the crypto rebates higher to 48 basis points?
Jason Warnick: Yeah, I'll go ahead and take both of those. So first on the crypto rebates, we've been experimenting for some time on crypto rebates and we've been seeing the rebate rate come up. We always want to have great prices for customers, but also balance the return that we generate for shareholders on that activity. And so we started the year at about 35 basis points and you've seen it move up, including in October where we're running at 48 basis points. In terms of futures and index options, those products really benefit from the broader technology structure that we have at the company. We have roughly 90% fixed costs base and relatively low variable costs and futures and index options benefit from that as well, which leads to really high incremental margins as we grow those businesses.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Advisor. Please go ahead.
Steven Chubak: Hi, good evening. I wanted to start off with a question on actually a chart that you had included in a recent presentation deck, just showing the strong relationship between revenues and AUC. It's been a persistent trend over the last few quarters. I mean, in this particular quarter, we did see some decoupling amid some of the rate cuts and subdued trading activity. And we're just hoping you could speak to your confidence level that, that relationship should ultimately still hold even amid the impact of further rate cuts from the Fed.
Vlad Tenev : Yeah, I feel really good about that relationship, Steven. I mean, one way to think about it is just bridging revenue from Q2 to Q3. There's really two things that distinguish our second quarter and our third quarter. The first is in the second quarter, we have seasonally high proxy revenue. That was about $30 million, and you saw that reduction in Q3 as we moved past that seasonal quarter. The second bridge item from Q2 to Q3 is the contra revenues on the match promotions. And in the quarter, we saw a step up to $27 million. That was an increase of about $14 million in contra revenues versus Q2. And I think that's showing up in the relationship that you're drawing to AUC. Importantly, most of the incremental $14 million related to the 1% boost on gold deposits, and that's something that we're winding down in November. So as we look forward to Q4, we expect Q4 to step up contra revenues in a similar amount that we saw from Q2 to Q3, but then subside and grow at a slower rate. Zooming out, I feel really good longer term about the core business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Stein with FT Partners. Please go ahead.
Andrew Stein: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wondering, could you discuss the deposit trends for some of the recent promotional offers? And then what's your strategy for deposit bonuses going forward? Thank you.
Jason Warnick: Yeah, we love the matches on deposits. We've seen customers really respond to it. From a finance perspective, we track the behavior of the cohorts and dollars that come in, and we've seen, for example, the 2023 match promotions have already paid off. The payback periods are around one year for 1% and kind of in the two to three year zone, trending more towards three years on the retirement matches that are 3%. So we feel really, really good about that. It's our third straight quarter of $10 billion plus in net deposits from our customers and continuing with a longer term trend of 20% plus growth. The Hood Week promotions that we did brought in $2 billion. So that was a two-week promotion and really, really strong response from customers. And in addition to the relatively quick payback periods, we just love the potential for compounding the facts for the business over time.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Madeline Gliden [ph] on for Ken. Thanks for taking our question. You discussed it a bit already, but we wanted to dig a little more into the strategy around the election-related event contracts. So could you walk us through your ultimate decision to list these event contracts, how they fit into the product roadmap, and ultimately, is Robinhood considering getting bigger into these more betting-type products? Thank you.
Vlad Tenev : Yeah. I'd say overall, as a philosophy, we want to make all product categories available for customers over time, particularly for active traders. We want Robinhood to be associated with being at the frontier of innovation and technology in financial services. So if you look specifically at these event contracts, they're regulated swaps markets that really serve as legitimate hedging instruments for large institutions. And we believe that if any tool or any instrument is available for institutions, then we have to make it available for retail as well. I think a nice other secondary impact is it provides people with a reliable data source about where predictions, where people predict the market will land.
Operator: This concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Vlad Tenev, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks.
Vlad Tenev : Yeah. Thank you. Thank you to everyone for listening and to our institutional and retail analysts for continuing to engage. And really, a special thank you to all the folks on social media who've been posting content and streaming using Robinhood Legend and sharing feedback. We really appreciate it.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",split transcript is available for premium subscribers only.,HOOD
2025-02-12,"Operator: Thank you to everyone for joining Robinhood’s Q4 and Full-Year 2024 Earnings Call. Joining today are CEO and Co-Founder Vlad Tenev; CFO, Jason Warnick; and senior manager of Investor Relations, Jack Riehemann. Vlad and Jason will offer opening remarks and then open the call to Q&A. During the Q&A portion of the call, we will answer questions from institutional research analysts, and we will also answer questions from retail analysts, who may hold an ownership position in Robinhood. As a reminder, today's call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations, and we have no duty to provide updates unless legally required. Potential risk factors that could cause differences, including regulatory developments that we continue to monitor, are described in the press release we issued today, the earnings presentation, and our SEC filings, all of which can be found at investors.robinhood.com. Today's discussion will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the GAAP measures we consider most comparable can be found in the earnings presentation. With that, please welcome, Vlad and Jason.
Vlad Tenev: All right. Good to see everyone. Thank you for being here for our first live video earnings call. Hopefully this is both informative, but also entertaining for everyone. Let me first start by saying that this was a big quarter for us. So we did over $1 billion in revenue for the first time as a public company, really for the first time in the history of the company. And that capped off what was a record breaking year with over $3 billion in revenue for the whole year. And yes, I would say that this was driven by a lot of things and let me remind you the three priorities we have as a public company So the first one is being number one in active traders. Second one is being number one in wallet share for the next generation and our long-term arc being the number one global financial ecosystem. I'm really proud of the product velocity in 2024. So the team executed unbelievably well. And there's a couple of things to point out. We began scaling the Robinhood gold card and Robinhood gold card. It wasn't just a me to credit card. I think we did a nice job building a revolutionary credit card and it has both best-in-class rewards and user experience. Robinhood Legend, which we announced at the Hood Summit event just a couple of months ago, our first desktop platform built from the ground up just for active traders. And I think what's been even more amazing than the initial launch is we not only rolled it out, but the team's been executing really well and adding new things on a weekly basis. It's been energizing to see the customer feedback and to see the team respond to that. New things are landing, new indicators, new features pretty much every week. And as a result, okay I should mention one other exciting thing. We added a whole new derivatives business. So Robinhood derivatives launched also last year at the Hood Summit and we're offering both futures outrides, and event contracts, which is an innovative new asset class that our customers are super excited about. So we're excited to do more there. As a result of this product velocity, we saw fantastic business results. I mentioned the $1 billion in revenue quarter, $3 billion for the full-year, which by the way, up 58% from 2023, almost, and 2 times from two years ago. And some of the things we track on a more input oriented basis. Market share up 30% year-over-year, both for equities and options. Record net deposits of over $50 billion, which is over 50 -- nearly 50% growth rate, multiples of what traditional brokerages are seeing. And gold subscribers also had a banner year up to a record of $2.6 million, which is 80% growth year-over-year. And now we're at over 10% attach rate if you look at the overall customer base, over 10% gold attach rate. And we've continued to see strength actually through 2025. We're closing in on 3 million gold subscribers. And perhaps the thing that I'm most excited by is if you look at the net new customer funded accounts in Q4, of those new customers that joined Robinhood in Q4, over 30% have adopted gold. So that 10% attach rate increases to well north of 30% if you look at new customers. So the team's been really executing well and there's more to do, but we're proud of the progress we've made there. There's going to be three events in 2025, three new product events, and the agendas are already packed. So we're very excited for them. Gold event is coming up in March in San Francisco. We're going to be launching a bunch of new products and features for the gold program, including advisory, which we've been working on and I think you guys are going to like what you see there. Our first crypto event in June, which will be in France. And then of course, Hood Summit, our active trader event, got great feedback, we're going to bring that back and that'll be later this year. So I'll talk a little bit about what you can expect in 2025, but first let me turn, turn it over to Jason for business and finance results.
Jason Warnick: Thanks, Vlad. Q4 was a record-setting quarter and 2024 a record-setting year. In both, we reached new highs for many of our financial measures and KPIs, including assets under custody, net deposits, gold subscribers, revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and earnings per share. Here's some of the full-year 2024 highlights. Revenues up 58% to nearly $3 billion, adjusted EBITDA up over 160% to $1.4 billion, and adjusted EBITDA margin grew to 48%. This really shows the operating leverage in our business with over 80% of top line growth dropping to the bottom line. And in our first full-year of positive net income, earnings per share was $1.56. We've built strong momentum entering 2025 and we're staying focused on delivering another year of profitable growth. So let's talk a bit about Q4. Revenues more than doubled year-over-year to $1 billion, driven by strong revenue growth, strong growth across the board, including transaction volumes, interest earning assets, securities lending, and gold subscriptions. And like you said, Vlad, Robinhood Gold subscribers are closing in on 3 million, driving annualized gold subscription revenue higher to now above 170 million. We also stayed disciplined on expenses in Q4. This brought full-year adjusted OpEx and SBC to $1.94 billion, up 7% year-over-year and within our original outlook. You may recall a couple years ago, we set a goal to bring share-based compensation as a percentage of revenue into the zone of 10%, down from higher levels in the past. So it feels really great. We achieved that milestone in 2024, and we're staying focused on managing this even lower over time. And as you saw, we had a large tax benefit in Q4. Given our recent strong performance and forecast of continued profits, we released most of our valuation allowance. We now expect our long-term tax rate to be more normalized in the mid-20% zone before any quarterly items. Now, as we look to 2025, we want to keep investing for profitable growth, while driving efficiency. So for revenues, we're planning on another year of double-digit growth, driven by product innovation, market share gains, and expanding into new markets. And on expenses, we'll keep managing our existing businesses to low-single-digit growth or even lower. And then make focused investments for growth for both new products on our roadmap and increasing marketing by another $100 million or so this year. And we're keeping our hands on the wheel as we monitor the environment and evaluate potential investment opportunities. So our outlook for adjusted OpEx and SBC is a range of $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion. Now, it's important to note that this does not include provisions for credit losses, any large regulatory charges, or anything related to our acquisitions of trade PMR or Bitstamp. And the midpoint of our outlook range is up about 10% from 2024. As for provisions for credit losses, these have been in the zone of about $20 million for the past couple of quarters, and we expect they'll gradually increase over time from here. As you know, this will really depend on balancing how quickly we onboard more customers and the underwriting risk, which we continue to manage closely. There's a couple other areas I'd like to highlight. First, we're now more than a quarter of the way through our $1 billion share buyback program and we're on track for a two to three year total timeline. As a result of repurchases and other actions that we've taken over the past couple years, we anticipate our diluted share count will be roughly flat in 2025. This means shareholders will benefit even more as we grow earnings and free cash flow over time. Second, we have a strong momentum to start the year. In January, net deposits were our second highest month ever, and equities, options, and crypto trading volumes were all up double to triple-digit growth rates from a year ago. In fact, January option volumes were an all-time high. It's also great to see January margin balances crossed $8 billion, doubling in the eight months since we moved to industry-leading pricing. And while it's early, we love the progress we're seeing with new products that we launched in the past few months. For example, looking at annualized trading revenue, Legend is now up to $50 million, and index options are up to $15 million and both are showing nice incrementality and strong week-over-week growth rates. So we feel great about our business and financial results and remain focused on driving another year of profitable growth in 2025. We're continuing to work to maximize earnings per share and free cash flow per share over time. Back to you, Vlad.
Vlad Tenev: It's really amazing to see how quickly Legend has become a $50 million business. I mean, that product launched and rolled out about two months ago. So, index options too at $15 million, incredibly strong. Many of you joined us for Investor Day just in December in New York, where we outlined the long-term strategy. So in a nutshell, we believe there are multiple ways to grow Robinhood 10 times over the next 10-years. And it's an ambitious plan, but we believe we have the right team, the right talent, and the right culture to deliver upon that. So let me tell you a little bit about what you can expect throughout 2025. So on the active trader front, we're going to keep pushing to make Legend the best platform for active traders on the market today. Our active traders should feel like they would be at a disadvantage using any other platform. We're also going to continue to add selection, and a comprehensive platform for event contracts is top of mind. It's a new, innovative asset class. Robinhood's going to be front and center in leading the way, offering that to customers. On the share of wallet front, we're going to grow the Robinhood gold card from about 100K card holders today to multiples of that size and that's very exciting. You'll hear more about that and a bunch more gold products for our members at our gold event in March. And for global financial ecosystem, our 10-year arc, there's actually a lot that we're going to get done this year. So maybe I'll go a little bit deeper here. So one, more selection of crypto tokens. So in the existing app, the Robinhood main app, we're going to keep adding and we're going to continue to accelerate. In fact, we've added seven new assets since the election. And as we continue to get more and more regulatory clarity, you should expect to see that continue and accelerate. We're also investing in the Robinhood wallet, which is a separate app, and it's our non-custodial crypto wallet. And that's the gateway to 1,000s of additional coins for our customers. We've seen a lot of good signs, increased engagement, increased usage, and we're going to keep making it better and better. And then we have Bitstamp. So as we integrate Bitstamp, it both allows us access to the exchange market, which is an institutional market. And we really see an opportunity there to drive the same sort of Robinhood effect that we've brought to retail to the institutional space with crypto. It also allows us to tap into Bitstamp global reach, where they're live in 50-plus countries. And so you should expect that to continue to accelerate this year. But what I'm perhaps most excited about is tokenization. So I think Robinhood is uniquely positioned at the intersection of traditional finance and defi. We're one of the few players that has scale both in traditional financial assets and cryptocurrencies. And what that means for us is bringing real assets onto crypto technology and giving people access to real world productive assets using crypto rails where they benefit from the liquidity and the other advantages of that technology. And what that means is equities, private investments, and more should be brought onto Crypto Technology to really unleash the true power of the crypto revolution. I talk a lot more about this in my op-ed in the Washington Post, so I encourage you guys to check that out. And I think we can make a lot of progress on that, not just globally outside the U.S., but even in the U.S. as well. So with that, just close by saying teams have been working incredibly hard. The road map is full. There's so much to do, and let's open it up to questions.
A - Jack Riehemann: Thanks, Vlad. For the Q&A session, we'll start by answering the top few shareholder questions from Say Technologies, ranked by number of votes. We passed over questions that we already addressed on this call or in prior quarters and grouped together questions that shared a common theme. After the Say questions, we'll turn to live questions from our analysts. So I'll kick it off with our first question from Say. First question is from Ali D who asks, when will the gold credit card be available to a broader audience? Vlad?
Vlad Tenev: Thanks, Ali. Very soon. So thank you, by the way, to all the customers, who have expressed interest and continue to express interest in the gold card. The demand for the card has been extreme, and I think that's really been driven by the product experience. So it's not just offering customers great rewards with 3% cash back, but the virtual cards and the digital features have gotten really amazing reviews. And we hear from customers every day how much they love it and how they can't believe that other credit cards don't have these features. So today we have a little over 100,000 card holders. We're working to roughly double that number in the next few months. And that's going to be on the way to growing that multiples of the 100,000 level this year. So we'd love to move even faster here, but this is about the speed at which successful credit card programs in recent years have rolled out. And I think it's just important to balance the speed of rollout and satisfying the demand with being incredibly prudent regarding the spending and borrowing activity. Jason, do you want to add anything to that?
Jason Warnick: Yeah, I'd just say, you know, Vlad, you and I have both heard Ravi, who runs credit at Robinhood, several times say how important it is that we be cautious in the short-term, so that we can be ambitious in the long-term. And I think we're striking the right balance. But obviously we want to move as quickly as possible for customers.
Vlad Tenev: Yes, and the rollout's increasing, so hopefully you'll get one soon.
Jack Riehemann: Thank you both. Our next question comes from Alex B who asks, will Robinhood offer the ability to do deeper analysis on individual stocks within the app? Will it have charts for financial data over time such as revenue, net income, et cetera. And have a feature to compare metrics versus other companies?
Vlad Tenev: Yes, thank you. I recognize that Alex B, congrats on having the two of the top three voted questions. In short, yes. So one of our goals is for Robinhood to have the very best information, research, and tools in-app. I think we started out offering the best service for you to actually place the transaction. And over time, we've been moving more upstream. And the goal is to not just be the best place to complete the transaction, but also the best place to do your research and to generate ideas. And over the past year, we've really been focusing on furthering that across the charting and the technical analysis experience across the product. You've seen that with Robinhood Legend, which as we mentioned earlier, is already up to a $50 million annualized revenue rate just after a few months. So we've been focusing on making the charting experience really, really good. Customers are now asking us to bring that into mobile and the team is continuing to execute constantly shipping new features, but there's more to do. You mentioned fundamental analysis in some of these more fundamental indicators. Those are on the list as well. There's plenty more to do. And the team is on it. We're excited to share more later this year at HOOD Summit, which is our active trader event.
Jack Riehemann: Thanks, Vlad. And around, I’d Say, Q&A, we have another question from Alex B, who asks, will Robinhood offer loans such as micro loans, auto loans, et cetera?
Vlad Tenev: So over the long term, the company will -- the company seeks and aims to fill all of our customers' financial needs. So we want to be the place where you can buy, sell or hold any financial asset and conduct any financial transaction. And that's a big part of our second arc, which is being number one in wallet share for the next generation. So of course, lending needs are a big part of that. Customers need to -- customers have borrowing needs. And we're going to address that in a number of ways. So first, we've really been focusing on the margin product. So we a little bit under, I guess, a year ago, about six to seven months ago. We revamped our margin offering. And we started offering industry-leading rates. Since then, the margin book has more than doubled. So we've really made tremendous progress there. Even after that doubling, we're -- we've got a long way to go to -- being competitive in terms of size with some of our incumbent competitors. So I think margin has a lot of room to run. We're going to continue to invest there. On the Credit Card side, which as well as a lending product, we've been making tremendous progress. That loan book has been growing as we get more and more customers on-boarded. And as you guys know, we've got a lot more customers to go. So our focus is on nailing those two products, which obviously have a sizable lending component. But once we do that, you should expect to see us cover the wide range of customer borrowing needs. So I encourage you guys once again -- Robinhood Gold customer event in March is -- going to be exciting
Jack Riehemann: That concludes our shareholder in from Say Technologies. We appreciate our shareholders taking time to ask these questions of Vlad and Jason and look forward to more next quarter. Now we will open the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Mike?
Michael Cyprys: Great. Hey, Vlad. Hey Jason. Congrats on the strong results here. Great to see. So you guys outlined an ambitious here to be number one in wallet share for the next generation and to broaden our services beyond trading. Given the early success that you've had so far with retirement and the wait list for credit card, can you just maybe talk about what hurdles you might face to achieve this ambitious goal? How you might overcome them and the progress you expect to make here in '25? Thank you.
Vlad Tenev: Yes. I'll take that one, Mike. Thanks for the question. I think we have a huge opportunity. The goal is over the long run to be the place where customers can buy, sell or hold any financial asset or conduct any financial transaction and to not get stuck with what worked for millennials, but also make sure that we're relevant as the financial home for the next generation. Now there's a couple of things that we have to continue to do. Number one; this opportunity isn't one that we're alone in wanting to pursue. I think that everyone wants to be the home for their customers' financial needs. And so it's going to involve us continuing to innovate, invest in technology, continue to pick the right products to focus on and make sure we're well positioned relative to our competitors in the two big technological shifts that are going to transform the financial industry, which are artificial intelligence, and crypto technology. And I think we're well positioned. We've got the team, the culture and the people to do this. So and you should see us accelerate more products, more features to further wallet share and put us in a position where I think relatively few companies are in to capture the $84-plus trillion in assets that are going to be flowing down to the younger generations in the next few decades.
Jack Riehemann: Great, thanks you, Vlad. Just a moment while we get our next person here. Our next question comes from Dan Dolev at Mizuho. Dan?
Dan Dolev: Hey, team great job is always epic results again. I have a quick question on sports contracts. You mentioned it at the Analyst Day, picked our interest. We did our own internal survey work, which showed massive opportunity with a significant amount of your users also engaged in sports betting. You started it out, it was shut down temporarily. So can you maybe lay out some of the long-term plans or medium-term plans for this very important part of the universe? Appreciate it.
Vlad Tenev: Thanks, Dan. Yes, I'll field that one. I think prediction markets are the future. I think they're the future not just as an active trading asset, but also news and information. And Robinhoods' going to be right there leading the way. I think we're going to continue to innovate and -- you saw this last year when we launched the presidential election market. So we were one of the few platforms that offered the ability to trade the election. And that was very successful for us. We had over 0.5 billion contracts traded in right around a week leading up to the election. And so what you should expect from us is a comprehensive events platform that will give access to prediction markets across a wide variety of contracts later this year. So the team has been hard at work at that. As with any new innovative asset class, we're pushing the boundaries here, and there's not regulatory clarity across all of it yet, in particular, sports, which you mentioned. But we believe in it, and we're going to be a leader. So you should expect us to not just offer it, but continue to drive and push for regulatory clarity industry-wide.
Jack Riehemann: Thank you, Vlad. And just a moment, please. Our next question comes from Patrick Moley at Piper Sandler. Patrick?
Patrick Moley: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I have kind of a two-parter guys. Don't get mad at me. But first, both on the crypto offering. First, in terms of -- Vlad you mentioned that the available tokens on the platform you're going to accelerate the rollout of tokens as we get more regulatory clarity. Can you maybe just specify what you mean by regulatory clarity? Are we waiting for comprehensive legislation? Or do you feel like there's going to be something else that can give you the green light to expand that offering. And then secondly, I noticed that you didn't mention staking, I think in your remarks. Is that still something that you're looking into on the crypto front? Thanks.
Vlad Tenev: Yes, absolutely. I mean, let me just say that we don't have any technological barriers to adding tokens or services like staking. They're live in the EU, for example, where we've been seeing great adoption in we have the engineering and the infrastructure capability to add tokens remarkably quickly. You guys might have seen that we were able to list the Trump token very quickly while maintaining the rigor and the approach around inauguration date. So yes, more regulatory clarity is needed across multiple domains. We have been adding more assets. But as I mentioned earlier, I think the real power of crypto technology is when it's able to be applied to real-world productive assets, which would be under the securities regime. So we still need a comprehensive set of rules and regulations for listing crypto asset securities. That will allow us to tokenize private companies, as well as public securities. And that's one of those things that we're going to be continuing to work on both overseas and in the U.S.
Jason Warnick: A couple of things that I would just add in. In terms of clarity, that would be helpful, particularly for coins that have the characteristics of the security, I think it would be helpful to get additional guidance on being able to safely list those coins. And I know the SEC has had remarks recently suggesting that they're looking at that. And I think that there's also a need for additional clarity on staking as well. And again, it's encouraging to see the improved backdrop. The administration appears very supportive of innovation in the crypto space which I think is going to be great for customers as well as great for the companies like Robinhood, they are competing in this space.
Jack Riehemann: Thank you both, Vlad and Jason. Our next question comes from Tanner from Future Investing. Tanner?
Vlad Tenev: Tanner?
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. Thank you so much for having me. I just wanted to say, you guys have some of the best pricing for Crypto in the market for retail. And yet even then your take rate is essentially going up quite substantially. Can you give us some insight on your pricing strategy and where you foresee the pricing will settle over time?
Jason Warnick: Sure. Thanks Tanner, I'll start and Vlad you can feel free to add in. If you go back far enough, our take rate was only 10 basis points and it was just a starting point. And since then, what you've seen is that we've been experimenting over time, balancing ensuring customers continue to get a great value proposition, but we balance that with shareholder returns. And we have been experimenting, and we have been giving customers a great price even as the take rate has increased. I think it's up 9 basis points this quarter versus last quarter. We're not done experimenting. It doesn't mean that it's going to keep going up. One of the areas that we're focused on is how to give more compelling pricing to the highest volume traders. And so we'll be experimenting there as well. But when we think of take rates for crypto, when we look at January, take rates are pretty much in line with what we saw in Q4.
Vlad Tenev: Yes. And the only thing I would add is one of the things we're pretty excited about is a feature called Smart Exchange Routing that we rolled out just a couple of weeks ago. And this was really preparing for -- when we integrate Bitstamp and we have an Exchange business and also part of the integration with Robinhood Legend, which is our active trader platform, a lot of active traders on the crypto side want to engage directly with the order book. So giving customers an option to route to exchange, see the exact exchange pricing and pay a fee on top of that rather than rebate, I think, is something that people have been requesting. So we're going to continue to work on that. Early results are promising, and we want to give customers more options while still maintaining industry-leading pricing across the board.
Jack Riehemann: Thanks, Vlad. Thanks, Jason. Our next question here comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Steven?
Steven Chubak: Thanks, Vlad. Thanks, Jason, for taking my questions. So I wanted to double-click into the crypto discussion and the evolving competitive landscape. As you've both noted, just given the strength of your crypto offering enable your view to grow meaningfully while still flexing some pricing power like once we have regulatory clarity, how would you frame the incremental revenue opportunity from launching additional Altcoins and leaning into opportunities or just staking and lending? And I was hoping you could also speak to the risks. One of the questions we get quite often is how do you handicap the risk of larger competitors entering the space and potentially at more competitive price points?
Jason Warnick: Yes, I'd maybe take the risk point first. I think consistent with more competitors entering the space, I think it's right to assume that crypto is becoming more mainstream and more accepted. I think we're beginning to see that -- you saw the strength of crypto in the quarter, a lot more customers were trading crypto. So while there may be more competition over time, I do expect that there will be greater demand for crypto as well. And sorry, this first part of the question you had for me?
Vlad Tenev: Yes. I mean maybe I would just add that -- what customers really love about trading crypto on Robinhood is that they not only have access to crypto, but they can trade equities, options, now futures, soon a comprehensive suite of event contracts all in one place. And so I think, obviously, we see some opportunity from continuing to roll out the offering, and we've invested a lot in the technology. And tokenization once permissible in the U.S., I think, is going to be a huge opportunity that Robinhood is going to be front and center in.
Jack Riehemann: Thanks for the question. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell at Deutsche Bank. Brian?
Brian Bedell: Oh, great. Great, thanks. Thanks, good afternoon, guys. If I can bundle one question in here on the new initiative. The Legend platform, the Index Options and also futures just in terms of the revenue that you quoted. How should we think about how that is pacing in terms of a growth rate? I guess, in other words, did you get a lot of take up initially and then the growth rate slowed? Or do you see that growth accelerating? And if you can comment on all three of those areas?
Vlad Tenev: You want to take that?
Jason Warnick: Sure. I mean as we mentioned, Legend is now up to a $50 million annual revenue run rate. Index Options, $15 million. Index Options just recently rolled out to everyone. And then Futures, we've just started rolling out. In terms of the growth rates, these are strong week-over-week growth rates. We feel really good about that. Stepping back, looking at the long-term, I would say each of these represent pretty substantial portions of the overall market. And we're demonstrating, I think, an ability to take market share and compete. And so early signals are strong. The week-over-week growth rates are strong, and we've got really positive feedback from customers. So where I'm sitting today, I'm really optimistic.
Vlad Tenev: Yes. And I'd say these things are compounding upon one another. So we rolled out Index Options on Robinhood Legend and that further accelerated the growth. And we see continued opportunities that I think will be tailwinds, not only is it going to continue to penetrate the customer base. But I think we see more opportunities on the option side for Robinhood Legend. Our customers are really happy with the equities trading experience. I think that's world-class on Legend. And I think we see some more opportunity on options to make it even better.
Jack Riehemann: Thanks for the question. Thanks, Vlad and Jason. All right. And our next question comes from Devin Ryan at Citizens JMP. Devin?
Devin Ryan: Thanks so much. Hi, Vlad. Hi, Jason. How are you?
Vlad Tenev: Hey, Devin.
Jason Warnick: Hey, Devin.
Devin Ryan: Hey and congratulations on the great end of the year and the business momentum. I want to shift gears a little bit and dig in on the custody opportunity for advisers. We're obviously now a few months removed from the TradePMR announcement. I know you still need to close that deal. But it would be great to get any anecdotes on how that deal has been received in the market, what the feedback has been from those advisers, whether you're seeing demand from other advisers in the market? And just really kind of big picture, how you're planning to differentiate in the RIA custody market? Obviously, a massive TAM, but just love an update on that as well. Thanks.
Vlad Tenev: Yes, yes. I'll field that one. I think we see advisory as a missed opportunity, and we're going to tackle it very, very aggressively. When we talk to advisers, including TradePMR customers, I think by far, the number one thing that gets everyone very excited is access to the Robinhood customer base. And I think what gets Robinhood customers excited is being able to talk to a human adviser. I think in particular, for customers that are a little bit older, closer to retirement, and have a lot of assets being able to access a human adviser to help them with their financial needs is absolutely critical. So I think we can solve both problems. I think we can appeal to customers that may be a little bit older, they have more comprehensive needs, and they love the digital experience of Robinhood, but would love a human adviser. And for a lot of these advisers, including TradePMR customers, these guys are entrepreneurs, and they see an opportunity for Robinhood to help them tap into the 25 million customers in the U.S., that are going to have their wealth growing tremendously over the next several decades, particularly as they inherit tens of trillions of dollars from older generations. So we see this as a big part of being the number one platform for wallet share for the next generation and really being the first truly multigenerational platform. We think that our customers' parent should be using Robinhood, their children should be using Robinhood, and nobody has really nailed that product experience, for what investment management and financial services looks like for the entire family. And I think not a lot are trying. We're having some success. The initial rollout there will be of the Credit Card, where it's actually a wonderful experience for the entire family, and you should expect to see us bringing more of that into Investment Management and Advisory.
Jack Riehemann: Thanks, Vlad. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Amit from Amit Is Investing.
Vlad Tenev: Never heard of them.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, Vlad. Hey, Jason. Thanks for taking my question and congrats again on an incredible quarter. Last year, you all told investors that as rates come down, you can expect more trading volumes, and that thesis has basically played out. I think right now, we're in a kind of a goldilocks zone where rates are strong enough for your net interest income to sustain itself, but not low enough to take away that income. So is the guide for 2025 similar to rates coming down would lead to an increase in trading volumes? Or is there a diversified view that investors should have on the impact of rates on the business?
Jason Warnick: Yes, I'll go ahead and take that. Thanks for the question. So the comments I gave on revenue is that we expect another year of double-digit revenue growth. So -- the precision that we were providing on guidance was really around OpEx at $2 billion to $2.1 billion. We are seeing that relationship, that natural hedge play out where rates go one direction and trading goes the other. And just looking at the print this morning and the updated expectations around rate cuts, I think there's still room for rates to come down this year. Maybe perhaps it's one cut or maybe two. But I feel like our business is really designed to thrive regardless of the macro backdrop on interest rates. And we've seen the pickup in trading, rates have come down, we're still, to your point, making strong interest. And we've been diversifying our business. As I mentioned at Investor Day a couple of months ago, we now have nine business areas with revenues over $100 million. So we feel like we're really well positioned, and it has been nice to see our thesis play out that there's a natural hedge in this business, and it's really been playing out and showcased in Q4.
Vlad Tenev: Yes. I just want to add there. We're building a business that's intended to not be reliant on external factors for revenue. So that's why even with our yield products like the Gold Sweep the goal would be to operate with a certain margin and vary that with the rates, but we want to be competitive and offer customers a great deal regardless of the rate environment and generate a small, but healthy margin regardless of the environment as well. Same goes for margin on the other side. That will become more compelling with rates going down. But it's still going to be a great business for us that we think we can continue to grow market share very quickly in.
Jack Riehemann: Thanks for the question. Just a moment. Our next question comes from Alex Markgraff at KeyBanc. Alex?
Alex Markgraff: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just as we think about some of the growth drivers for '25, I would be curious to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about the approach to deposit incentive offerings in '25? I think, proved pretty successful in '24. So any updated thinking there for '25 would be great? And then, Jason, if you could just clarify on the Legend revenue account or the Legend revenue number of $50 million. Is that viewed as entirely incremental at this point? Thank you.
Jason Warnick: Yes, I'll start with the incrementality. So the data is still pretty early. We've seen enough to be confident that there's strong incrementality here on Legend. We're going to let it play out a little bit more before we provide additional clarity, but it's nice to see. We are seeing a very strong uptake on Legend from existing customers. We're also seeing new customers. And I think over time, there's going to be -- particularly as we round out the product suite and the user experience an opportunity to really grow incrementally with existing customers and bringing on more new customers. Vlad, do you want to take deposit incentives?
Vlad Tenev: Yes. Yes. On the deposit incentives front, we've got one going right now for retirement. That's going to be on incoming transfers and rollovers. And that's very exciting. Actually, we've been seeing a lot of rollovers. The rollovers experience is much smoother than it was last year. So there's been tremendous improvement there. We also are offering and experimenting with APY boost incentives on the Gold program and those are much more personalized. So I think the future is more personalization where we actually really lean into our strengths as a technology organization -- and yes, we expect to continue to make great progress. I mean, $50 billion in net deposits over 2024, was a big number, multiples of how fast incumbents are growing, and we see plenty more opportunity to grow our business.
Jason Warnick: Yes. And I would just add that we love the economics on these deposit matches. The payback periods and the overall economics are very attractive and growing assets is just great for business. So we'll keep that going.
Jack Riehemann: Thank you both. And our next question here comes from Ben Budish at Barclays. Ben?
Ben Budish: Hi, good evening and thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could unpack a little bit more detail around your new Gold members. How many of them are net new to Robinhood? What's the sort of activity associated with the credit card. How many of them are net new to Robinhood, how many of them are new gold members? And what sort of activities are you seeing sort of associated with the adoption of the card itself, are you seeing bigger balances, stronger deposits? How should we think about that as sort of a -- additive to kind of your platform approach to the customer?
Vlad Tenev: Yes. I mean, first off, we're investing a lot in the Gold program. And I think you guys are seeing the fruits there. When someone becomes a Gold subscriber, they grow AUC, Assets Under Custody much more rapidly, net deposits more rapidly, and they adopt our products at a much higher rate. So the journey is basically someone joins Robinhood. They become a gold member relatively quickly and then their rate of assets under custody, net deposit growth and multiproduct adoption increases. And so we've really made a ton of progress growing the attach rate, particularly early on in the customer's journey with Robinhood. I think we mentioned in Q4, out of the new net funded accounts to Robinhood north of 30% into the quarter as Gold subscribers, which I think is just tremendous as an attach rate, and I think we can continue to work on that. With the Gold Card, in particular, one of the really interesting things, and I think we're actually one of the few that are capable of measuring this as an integrated platform. But we are seeing strong second order effects between users of the credit card and the core brokerage business, which I think validates our thesis that there's a Gold flywheel. And if we sort of like make each of the individual pieces better the overall customer value to the Robinhood ecosystem benefits tremendously.
Jason Warnick: And in terms of the cardholders, so we're a little over 100,000 cardholders at this point. We plan to increase that by several hundred thousand this year. In terms of the mix between kind of new customers or new to Gold customers, there's a healthy portion of our wait list that are not currently Gold members. So we see that as a big opportunity.
Jack Riehemann: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Roy from Crossroads Investing. Roy?
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks for having me, guys. Tremendous quarter. I love seeing the rollout of Options at the U.K. this week. And I'd really like to hear more about the international expansion, specifically if future international expansions are going to follow a similar road map as the U.K. launched, starting with equities, building on products from there. And then specific country products such as [Indiscernible] in the U.K. And I'd also like to know if those are coming out later this year in the U.K. as well?
Vlad Tenev: Hey Roy, short answer, yes. Yes, we're spending a lot of -- we're going to make a lot of progress internationally this year. We were extremely happy with the Options launch. That makes us one of the few brokers that are offering Options trading in the U.K. And the response to that from customers, maybe you saw in socials was quite positive. So customers in the U.K. wanted it, we're happy to deliver -- and I think in the future, we're going to continue to round out the offering and the benefits of having an integrated platform with a single technology stack is as we continue to roll out things in the U.S. they'll accrue to international markets. 24-hour market is an example. Now that we have Futures, once we get regulatory clarity, you will look to be offering that in the U.K. as well. And in the EU, the focus is, again, on rounding out the product suite as well. And we're also looking ahead to other markets. The goal is for Robinhood to be everywhere, be anywhere be where customers have smartphones, you should be able to open up a Robinhood account and benefit from our suite of best-in-class financial services. So you should expect us to not just round out the product suite in our current Geos. But expand from there. And the team has been doing a nice job accelerating that.
Jason Warnick: Yes. And I think in terms of the sequence of products, if you look to the EU, we started with crypto in the U.K., we started with brokerage. I don't think that there's necessarily a set playbook on what goes first. It's going to depend on the market that we enter.
Vlad Tenev: Yes. I tell you, yes, look out for that. I think we've been talking a lot about the Gold event, but we're going to have our first Crypto event, which is going to be in France around midyear. So we've got that agenda already packed.
Jack Riehemann: Thanks, Jason. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Ken?
Jason Warnick: Hey, Ken.
Ken Worthington: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to dig in a little bit deeper on the credit card. You have balances, I think, both on and off balance sheet. How do the economics work between on and off balance sheet, and what happens with credit risk between those two buckets?
Jason Warnick: Yes. So credit risk is very similar between the two. We're holding the risk and the economics are also very similar as well. And I think as we go forward, this is something that the team is evaluating and we'll be optimizing over time.
Jack Riehemann: Thank you, Jason. Thanks, Ken. Our next question comes from John Todaro for Needham. John?
John Todaro: Hey, guys congrats on a great quarter. A question on the Crypto side. Vlad, I remember you called out Stable Coins pretty positively back in December, and they've obviously grown a ton over the last few months. Just wondering if there's more possibilities of kind of doing some direct product launches around Stable Coins and monetizing that adoption a bit more?
Vlad Tenev: Yes, absolutely. As you guys probably know, we entered into -- we have USDG that we partnered with a few other great companies on the global dollar network, which is going to be a stable coin that passes back yield to holders, which we think is the future. I think many of the leading Stable Coins don't have a great way to pass yield to holders. And that makes them not ideal for holding in that form. So you see a lot of use for transaction, moving money back and forth. But in terms of actually like holding dollars in Stable Coin form, yield is an important piece. I should say that we're -- we see the power of that of the Stable coin ourselves as a company. So I don't think it's just interesting for retail, but there's benefits to the technology in the 24-hour instant settlements for us as a business. And in particular, we're using Stable Coin to power a lot of our weekend settlements now, and we're using it increasingly. And I think Robinhood's going to be an early adopter of that, but we should expect that those benefits that we're seeing other companies will eventually come to realize, and that will be a tailwind for institutional Stable Coin adoption industry-wide. So stay tuned. There's going to be a lot more on the dollar global network. And yes, we're going to be investing in this space.
Jack Riehemann: That's great. Thanks, Vlad. Our next question comes from Evan from Stock Market News. Evan?
Unidentified Analyst: Awesome. I appreciate you guys for having me. Thank you for taking the question. Congratulations to you guys on the quarter. We've talked about a lot of very different opportunities here, and I appreciate a good job passing $1 billion. You talked about a lot of different opportunities for crypto, active traders, international opportunities, prediction markets. How do you go about ranking these different opportunities, maybe in both the scale of them and how immediate you might be deploying these finite resources to them? And do you guys think you need more people or more resources to go in and attack all of these opportunities you guys see?
Vlad Tenev: Yes, yes. Capital allocation is kind of the job, right, resource allocation, capital allocation is what we do. I'd say these are the three arcs of our business. So if you look at being number one in active traders, that's the near-term arc. So improvements that we make to the products and new features immediately or very, very quickly generate more revenue. I think you're seeing that with Robinhood Legend and Index Options where a handful of months after launch, Legends already had a $50 million annualized revenue rate, which is pretty amazing, and Active Traders were scaled, new product enhancements immediately result in more revenue for the business, more business value. That gives us fuel to pursue our other two arcs, which are longer term. So I would think about it not as we're going to nail active traders, then we're going to be number one in wallet share. And then 10-years from now, we'll start working on international. We're pursuing these independently. They're going to build off of each other -- and the tool -- the revenue and the resources we get from Active Traders are going to fuel expansion into bigger and broader markets. So I think it's exciting. What's even more exciting, and I'm sure Jason agrees with this. is being able to do all of this and execute while keeping OpEx growth to a minimum. So keeping our hands on the wheel, as you would say, and I think that just comes down to our embracive technology. I think we've seen a lot of benefits from adopting AI technologies becoming more efficient. We've seen that on the software engineering side, but really across the board. And I think there's more tailwinds there. There's a lot more we can do, but we do believe we can continue to increase product velocity, roll out more features and grow while keeping OpEx growth in check. I think that's just from any good company, leveraging AI, you should expect to see that in the future.
Jason Warnick: Yes. There's no shortage of ambitions to drive growth, and we've been allocating head count where necessary. But you saw the tremendous growth that we drove in 2024, yet the OpEx did not go up that much. And that's not an accident. We have a very expense light business model. I've talked a lot in the past about how 90% of our OpEx is fixed cost, and that was really showcased this quarter in Q4 as over 8% of the incremental revenue dropped to the bottom line, in terms of profit. But when we look around, we're not constraining the business from -- with resources. We're really doing as much as we think we can prudently manage and roll out with a high-quality product for customers.
Jack Riehemann: Thanks, Jason. Thanks, Vlad. That concludes the Q&A portion of our call. Before we end the stream, I'd like to give it back to Vlad for any closing remarks. Vlad?
Vlad Tenev: Well, I'd like to thank Jack. I know we promised Chris in the flash, but he was under the weather. Jack, I think you did a very, very nice job with that. Yes, I think that I want to thank you guys. Hopefully, you enjoyed the new format, both retail analysts and institutional analysts who've been along for the journey. It's been a strong quarter, but we're nowhere close to done. This is going to be a big intense year for us. And I think the team is super energized at the opportunity ahead and delivering even more for our customers. Thank you.

2024,Q1,2024-04-23,"Martin Viecha: Tesla's First Quarter 2024 Q&A Webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 3.00 p.m. Central Time in the Update Deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events and results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?
Elon Musk: Thanks, Martin. So to recap in Q1 we navigated several unforeseen challenges as well as the ramp of the updated Model 3 in Fremont. There was, as we all have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead. We believe this is not the right strategy and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market. Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead. It will increase. We actually know that it will, so significantly faster than the car business as we expected. We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially. In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in the past several weeks. We've updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup production in the second half of 2025, so we expect it to be more like the early 2025, if not late this year. These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup. So it's not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line. It'll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently. And we think this should allow us to get to over 3 million vehicles of capacity when realized to the full extent. Regarding FSD Version 12, which is the pure AI-based self-driving, if you haven't experienced this, I strongly urge you to try it out. It's profound and the rate of improvement is rapid so – and we've now turned that on for all cars with the cameras and inference computer and everything from Hardware 3 on in North America. And so it's been pushed out to, I think, around 1.8 million vehicles and we're seeing about half of people use it so far and that percentage is increasing with each passing week. So we now have over 300 billion miles that have been driven with FSD V12. Since the launch of full self-driving, supervised full self-driving, it's become very clear that the vision-based approach with end to end neural networks is the right solution for scalable autonomy. It's really how humans drive. Our entire road network is designed for biological neural nets and eyes. So naturally cameras and digital neural nets are the solution to our current road system. To make it more accessible, we've reduced the subscription price to $99 a month, so it's easy to try out. And as we've announced, we'll be showcasing our purpose-built robotaxi, or Cybercab, in August. Yes. Regarding AI compute, over the past few months, we've been actively working on expanding Tesla's core AI infrastructure. For a while there, we were training constrained in our progress. We are, at this point, no longer training constrained and so we're making rapid progress. We've installed and commissioned, meaning they're actually working 35,000 H100 computers or GPUs, GPU is wrong word, they need a new word. I always feel like a wince when I say GPU because it's not – GPU stands – G stands for graphics, and it doesn't do graphics. But anyway roughly 35,000 H100s are active, and we expect that to be probably 85,000 or thereabouts by the end of this year and training, just for training. We are making sure that we're being as efficient as possible in our training. It's not just about the number of H100s, but how efficiently they're used. So in conclusion, we're super excited about our autonomy road map. I think it should be obvious to anyone who's driving Version 12 and it tells that that it is only a matter of time before we exceed the reliability of humans and not much time with that. And we're really headed for an electric vehicle, an autonomous future. And I'll go back to something I said several years ago that in the future, gasoline cars that are not autonomous will be like riding a horse and using a flip phone. And that will become very obvious in hindsight. We continue to make the necessary investments that will drive growth and profits for Tesla in the future, and I wanted to thank the Tesla team for incredible execution during this period and look forward to everything that we have planned ahead. Thanks.
Martin Viecha: Thank you very much, and Vaibhav has some comments as well.
Vaibhav Taneja: Thanks. It's important to acknowledge what Elon said, from our auto business perspective. We did see a seasonal decline in revenues quarter-over-quarter and those were primarily because of seasonality, uncertain macroeconomic environment and the other reasons, which Elon had mentioned earlier. Auto margins declined from 18.9% to 18.5%. Excluding the impact of Cybertruck, the impact of pricing actions was largely offset by reductions in per unit costs and the recognition of revenue from Autopark feature for certain vehicles in the U.S. that previously did not have that functionality. Additionally, while we did experience higher cost due to the ramp of Model 3 in Fremont and disruptions in Berlin, these costs were largely offset by cost reduction initiatives. In fact, if we exclude Cybertruck and Fremont Model 3 ramp costs, the revenue from Autopark, auto margins improved slightly. Currently normalized Model Y cost per vehicle in Austin and Berlin are already very close to that of Fremont. Our ability to reduce costs without sacrificing on quality was due to the amazing efforts of the team, in executing Tesla's relentless pursuit of efficiency across the business. We've also witnessed that as other OEMs are pulling back on their investments in EV, there is increasing appetite for credits, and that means a steady stream of revenue for us. Obviously, seeing others pull back from EV is not the future we want. We would prefer it the whole industry went all in. On the demand front, we've undertaken a variety of initiatives, including lowering the price of both the purchase and subscription options for FSD launching extremely attractive leasing specials for the Model 3 in the U.S. for $299 a month and offering attractive financing options in certain markets. We believe that our awareness activities, paired with attractive financing, will go a long way in expanding our reach and driving demand for our products. Our Energy business continues to make meaningful progress with margins reaching a record of 24.6%. We expect the energy storage deployments for 2024 to grow at least 75% higher from 2023. And accordingly, this business will begin contributing significantly to our overall profitability. Note that there is a bit of lumpiness in our storage deployments due to a variety of factors that are outside of our control, so deployments may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter. On the operating expense front, we saw a sequential increase from our AI initiatives, continued investment in future projects, marketing and other activities. We had negative free cash flow of $2.5 billion in the first quarter. The primary driver of this was an increase in inventory from a mismatch between builds and deliveries as discussed before, and our elevated spend on CapEx across various initiatives, including AI compute. We expect the inventory build to reverse in the second quarter and free cash flow to return to positive again. As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, we had to make the hard but necessary decision to reduce our head count by over 10%. The savings generated are expected to be well in excess of $1 billion on an annual run rate basis. We are also getting hyper focused on CapEx efficiency and utilizing our installed capacity in a more efficient manner. The savings from these initiatives, including our cost reductions will help improve our overall profitability and ultimately enable us to increase the scale of our investments in AI. In conclusion, the future is extremely bright and the journey to get there while challenging will be extremely rewarding. Once again, I would like to thank the whole Tesla team for delivering great results. And we can open it up to Q&A.
A - Martin Viecha: Okay. Let's start with investor Q&A. The first question is, what is the status of 4680. What is the current output? Lars?
Lars Moravy : Sure. 4680 production increased about 18% to 20% from Q4 reaching greater than 1K a week for Cybertruck, which is about 7 gigawatt hours per year as we posted on X. We expect to stay ahead of the Cybertruck ramp with the cell production throughout Q2 as we ramp the third of four lines in Phase 1, while maintaining multiple weeks of cell inventory to make sure we're ahead of the ramp. Because we're ramping, COGS continues to drop rapidly week-over-week driven by yield improvements throughout the lines and production volume increases. So our goal, and we expect to do this is to beat supplier cost of nickel-based cells by the end of the year.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The second question is on Optimus. So what is the current status of Optimus? Are they currently performing any factory tasks? When do you expect to start mass production?
Elon Musk: We are able to do simple factory tasks or at least, I should say, factory tasks in the lab. In terms of – we do think we will have Optimus in limited production in the natural factory itself, doing useful tasks before the end of this year. And then I think we may be able to sell it externally by the end of next year. These are just guesses. As I've said before, I think Optimus will be more valuable than everything else combined. Because if you've got a sentient humanoid robots that is able to navigate reality and do tasks at request, there is no meaningful limit to the size of the economy. So that's what is going to happen. And I think Tesla is best positioned of any humanoid robot maker to be able to reach volume production with efficient inference on the robot itself. I mean this perhaps is a point that is worth emphasizing Tesla's AI inference efficiency is vastly better than any other company. There is no company even close to the inference efficiency of Tesla. We've had to do that because we were constrained by the inference hardware in the car, we didn't have a choice. But that will pay dividends in many ways.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The third question is, what is the current assessment of the pathway towards regulatory approval for unsupervised FSD in the U.S. And how should we think about the appropriate safety threshold compared to human drivers?
Elon Musk: Sure.
Lars Moravy: I can start. There are a handful of states that already have adopted autonomous vehicle laws. These states are paving the way for operations, while the data for such operations guides a broader adoption of driver-less vehicles. I think Ashok can talk a little bit about our safety methodology, but we expect that these states and the work ongoing as well as the data that we're providing will pave a way for a broad-based regulatory approval in the U.S. at least and then in other countries as well?
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes. It's actually been pretty helpful that other autonomous car companies have been cutting a path through the regulatory jungle, which is absurd. That's actually quite helpful. And they have obviously been operating in San Francisco for a while. I think they got approval for City of LA. So these approvals are happening rapidly. I think if you've got at scale, a statistically significant amount of data that shows conclusively that the autonomous car has, let's say, half the accident rate of a human-driven car, I think, that's difficult to ignore because at that point, stopping autonomy means killing people. So I actually do not think that there will be significant regulatory barriers provided there was conclusive data that the autonomous car is safer than a human-driven car. And in my view, this will be much like elevators. Elevators used to be operated by a guy with relay switch. But sometimes that guy would get tired or drunk or just make a mistake, and shatter somebody in half between floors. So we just get an elevator and press button, we don't think about it. In fact, it's kind of weird if somebody is standing there with a relay switch. And that will be how cars work. You just summon the car using your phone, you get in, it takes you to a destination, you get out.
Vaibhav Taneja: You don't even think about it?
Elon Musk: You don't even think about it. Just like an elevator, it takes you to your floor. That's it. Don't think about how the elevator is working or anything like that. And something I should clarify is that Tesla will be operating the fleet. So you can think of like how Tesla, think of it’s like some combination of Airbnb and Uber, meaning that there will be some number of cars that Tesla owns itself and operates in the fleet. There will be some number of cars and then there'll be a bunch of cars where they're owned by the end user. That end user can add or subtract their car to the fleet whenever they want, and they can decide if they want to only let the car be used by friends and family or only by 5-star users or by anyone at any time they could have the car come back to them and be exclusively theirs, like an Airbnb. You could rent out your guest room or not, any time you want. So as our fleet grows, we have 7 million cars going to – 9 million cars going to, eventually tens of millions of cars worldwide. With a constant feedback loop, every time something goes wrong, that gets added to the training data and you get this training flywheel happening in the same way that Google Search has the sort of flywheel, it's very difficult to compete with Google because people are constantly doing searches and clicking and Google is getting that feedback loop. It’s the same with Tesla. But at a scale that is maybe difficult to comprehend, but ultimately, it will be tens of millions. I think there's also some potential here for an AWS element down the road where if we've got very powerful inference because we've got a Hardware 3 in the cars, but now all cars are being made with Hardware 4. Hardware 5 is pretty much designed and should be in cars, hopefully towards the end of next year. And there's a potential to run – when the car is not moving to actually run distributed inference. So kind of like AWS, but distributed inference. Like it takes a lot of computers to train an AI model, but many orders of magnitude less compute to run it. So if you can imagine future, perhaps where there's a fleet of 100 million Teslas, and on average, they've got like maybe a kilowatt of inference compute. That's 100 gigawatts of inference compute distributed all around the world. It's pretty hard to put together 100 gigawatts of AI compute. And even in an autonomous future where the car is, perhaps, used instead of being used 10 hours a week, it is used 50 hours a week. That still leaves over 100 hours a week where the car inference computer could be doing something else. And it seems like it will be a waste not to use it.
Martin Viecha: Ashok, do you want to chime in on the air process and safety?
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes, we have multiple tiers of validating the safety in any given week, we train hundreds of neural networks that can produce different trajectories for how to drive the car, we replay them through the millions of clips that we have already collected from our users and our own QA. Those are like critical events, like someone jumping out in front or like other critical events that we have gathered database over many, many years, and we replay through all of them to make sure that we are net improving safety. And on top of it, we have simulation systems that also try to recreate this and test this in closed loop fashion. And some of this is validated, we give it to our own QA drivers. We have hundreds of them in different cities, in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, New York, a lot of different locations. They are also driving this and collecting real-world miles, and we have an estimate of what are the critical events, are they a net improvement compared to the previous week’s builds. And once we have confidence that the build is a net improvement, then we start shipping to early users, like 2,000 employees initially that they would like it to build, they will give feedback on like if it's an improvement there or they're noting some new issues that we did not capture in our own QA process. And only after all of this is validated, then we go to external customers. And even when we go external, we have like live dashboards of monitoring every critical event that's happening in the fleet sorted by the criticality of it. So we are having a constant pulse on the build quality and the safety improvement along the way. And then any failures like Elon alluded to, we get the data back, add it to the training and that improves the model in the next cycle. So we have this like constant feedback loop of issues, fixes, evaluations and then rinse and repeat. And especially with the new V12 architecture, all of this is automatically improving without requiring much engineering interventions in the sense that engineers don't have to be creative in like how they code the algorithms. It's mostly learning on its own based on data. So you see that, okay, every failure or like this is how a person shows, this is how you drive this intersection or something like that, they get the data back. We add it to the neural network, and it learns from that trained data automatically instead of some engineers saying that, oh, here, you must rotate the steering wheel by this much or something like that. There's no hard inference conditions, it's everything is neural network, it's very soft, it's probabilistic. So it will adapt its probability distribution based on the new data that it's getting.
Elon Musk: Yes. We do have some insight into how good the things will be in like, let's say, three or four months because we have advanced models that are far more capable than what is in the car, but have some issues with them that we need to fix. So they are like there'll be a step change improvement in the capabilities of the car, but it will have some quirks that are – that need to be addressed in order to release it. As Ashok was saying, we have to be very careful in what we release the fleet or to customers in general. So like – if we look at say 12.4 and 12.5, which are really could arguably even be Version 13, Version 14 because it's pretty close to a total retrain of the neural nets in each case are substantially different. So we have good insight into where the model is, how well the car will perform, in, say, three or four months.
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes. In terms of scaling laws, people in the AI community generally talk about model scaling laws where they increase the model size a lot and then their corresponding gains in performance, but we have also figured out scaling laws and other access in addition to the model side scaling, making also data scaling. You can increase the amount of data you use to train the neural network and that also gives similar gains and you can also scale up by training compute, you can train it for much longer or make more GPUs or more Dojo nodes and that also gives better performance, and you can also have architecture scaling where you count with better architectures that for the same amount of compute for produce better results. So a combination of model size scaling, data scaling, training compute scaling and the architecture scaling, we can basically extract like, okay, with the continue scaling based on this – at this ratio, we can sort of predict future performance. Obviously, it takes time to do the experiments because it takes a few weeks to train, it takes a few weeks to collect tens of millions of video clips and process all of them, but you can estimate what’s going to be the future progress based on the trends that we have seen in the past, and they’re generally held true based on past data.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Thank you very much. I’ll go to the next question, which is, can we get an official announcement of the time line for the $25,000 vehicle?
Lars Moravy: I think we – Elon mentioned it in the opening remarks. But as you mentioned, we’re updating our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of our low-cost vehicles in a more CapEx efficient way. That’s our mission to get the most affordable cars to customers as fast as possible. These new vehicles we built on our existing lines and open capacity, and that’s a major shift to utilize all our capacity with marginal CapEx before we go spend high CapEx to do anything.
Elon Musk: Yes. We’ll talk about this more on August 8. But really, the way to think of Tesla is almost entirely in terms of solving autonomy and being able to turn on that autonomy for a gigantic fleet. And I think it might be the biggest asset value appreciation history when that day happens when you can do unsupervised full self-driving.
Lars Moravy: 5 million cars?
Elon Musk: Yes.
Lars Moravy: A little less?
Elon Musk: Yes. It will be 7 million cars in a year or so and then 10 million and then eventually, we’re talking about tens of millions of cars. Not eventually, it’s like, yes, for the end of the decade, its several tens of millions of cars I think.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, what is the progress of Cybertruck ramp?
Lars Moravy: I can take that one too. Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago. This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP [ph] late last year. Of course, volume production is what matters. That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost efficiency and quality.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Thank you. The next question, have any of the legacy automakers contacted Tesla about possibly licensing FSD in the future?
Elon Musk: We’re in conversations with one major automaker regarding licensing FSD.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is about the robotaxi unveil. Elon already talked about that. So we’ll have to wait till August. The following question is about the next-generation vehicle. We already talked about that. So let’s go to the semi. What is the time line for scaling semi?
Elon Musk: I think…
Lars Moravy: So we’re finalizing the engineering of the semi to enable like a super cost-effective high-volume production with our learnings from our fleet and our pilot fleet and Pepsi’s fleet, which we are expanding this year marginally. In parallel, as we showed in the shareholders’ deck, we have started construction on the factory in Reno. Our first vehicles are planned for late 2025 with external customers starting in 2026.
Martin Viecha: Okay. A couple more questions. So our favorite, can we make FSD transfer permanent until FSD is fully delivered with Level 5 autonomy?
Lars Moravy: Yes.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Next question, what is the getting the production ramp at Lathrop, where do you see the Megapack run rate at the end of the year. Mike?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes. Yes, Lathrop is ramping as planned. We have our second GA line allowing us to increase our exit rate from 20 gigawatt hours per year to – at the start of this year to 40 gigawatt hours per year by the end of the year, that lines commissioned. There’s really nothing limiting the ramp. Its given the longer sales cycles for these large projects, we typically have order visibility 12 months to 24 months prior to ship dates. So we’re able to plan – the build plan several quarters in advance. So this allows us to ramp the factory to align with the business and order growth. Lastly, we’d like to thank our customers globally for their trust in Tesla as a partner for these incredible projects.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Thank you very much. Let’s go to analyst questions. The first question comes from Tony Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Tony, please go ahead and unmute.
Tony Sacconaghi: Thank you for taking the question. I was just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on kind of the new vehicles that you talked about today. Are these like tweaks on existing models, given that they’re going to be running on the same lines? Are these like new models? And how should we think about them in the context of like the Model 3 Highland update, what will these models be like relative to that? And given the quick time frame, Model 3 Highland has required a lot of work and a lot of retooling. Maybe you can help put that all in context. Thank you, and I have a follow-up, please.
Elon Musk: I think we've said, we were on that front. So what’s your follow-up?
Tony Sacconaghi: It’s a more personal one for you, Elon, which is that you’re leading many important companies right now. Maybe you can just talk about where your heart is at in terms of your interests and do you expect to lessen your involvement with Tesla at any point over the next three years?
Elon Musk: Tesla constitutes a majority of my work time and I work pretty much every day of the week. It’s rare for me to take a Sunday afternoon. So I’m going to make sure Tesla is quite prosperous. And it is – like it is prosperous and it will be very much so in the future.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Thank you. Let’s go to Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Adam, please go ahead and unmute.
Adam Jonas: Okay. Great. Hey, Elon. So you and your team on volume expect a 2024 growth rate, notably lower than that achieved in 2023. But what's your team's degree of confidence on growth above 0%? Or in other words, does that statement leave room for potentially lower sales year-on-year?
Elon Musk: No, I think we'll have higher sales this year than last year.
Adam Jonas: Okay. My follow-up, Elon, on future product. If you had nailed execution, assuming that you nail execution on your next-gen cheaper vehicles, more aggressive giga castings, I don't want to say one piece, but getting closer to one piece, structural pack, unboxed, 300-mile range, $25,000 price point, putting aside robotaxi, those features unique to you. How long would it take your best Chinese competitors to copy a cheaper and better vehicle that you could offer a couple of years from now? How long would it take your best Chinese competitors to copy that? Thanks.
Elon Musk: I mean, I don't know what our competitors could do, except we've done relatively better than they have. If you look at the drop in our competitors in China sales versus our drop in sales, our drop was less than theirs. So we're doing well. But I think Cathy Wood said it best, like really, we should be thought of as an AI or robotics company. If you value Tesla as just like an auto company, you just have to – fundamentally, it's just the wrong framework and it will come to be. If you ask the wrong question, then the right answer is impossible. So I mean, if somebody doesn't believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company. Like, that is – but we will and we are. And then you have a car that goes from 10 hours of use a week, like 1.5 hours a day to probably 50%, but it costs the same.
Vaibhav Taneja: I think that's the key thing to remember, right, especially if you look at FSD Supervised, if you didn't believe in autonomy, this should give you a review that this is coming. It's actually getting better day by day.
Elon Musk: Yes. If you've not tried the FSD 12.3, and like I said, 12.4 is going to be significantly better and 12.5 even better than that. And we have visibility into those things. Then you really don't understand what's going on. It's not possible.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes. And that's why we can't just look at just as a car company because a car company would just have a car. But here, we have more than a car company because the cars can be autonomous. And like I said, it's happening.
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes. This is all in addition to Tesla – the overall AI community is just like increasing – like, improving rapidly.
Elon Musk: Yes. I mean we're putting the actual auto in automobile. So sort of – we go like, well, sort of like tell us about future horse carriages you're making. I'm like, well, actually, it doesn't need a horse that's the whole point. That's really the whole point.
Martin Viecha: Okay, thank you. The next question comes from Alex Potter from Piper Sandler. Alex, please go ahead and unmute.
Alex Potter: Great, thanks. Yes, so I couldn't agree more. The thesis hinges completely on AI, the future of AI, full self-driving neural net training, all of these things. In that context, Elon, you've spoken about your desire to obtain 25% voting control of the company. And I understand completely why that would be. So I'm not necessarily asking about that. I'm asking if you've come up with any mechanism by which you can ensure that you'll obtain that level of voting control. Because if not, then the core part of the thesis could potentially be at risk. So any additional commentary you might have on that topic.
Elon Musk: Well, I think no matter what Tesla, even if I got kidnapped by aliens tomorrow, Tesla will solve autonomy, maybe a little slower, but it would solve autonomy for vehicles at least. I don't know if it would winon with respect to Optimus or with respect to future products, but it would that there's enough momentum for Tesla to solve autonomy even if I disappeared for vehicles. Yes, there's a whole range of things we can do in the future beyond that. I'll be more reticent with respect to Optimus, if we have a super-sentient humanoid robot that can follow you indoors and that you can escape, we're talking terminator-level risk. And yes, I'd be uncomfortable with. If there's not some meaningful level of influence over how that is deployed. And if there's shareholders have an opportunity to ratify or reratify the sort of competition because I can't say that. That is a fact. They have an opportunity. And yes, we'll see. If the company generates a lot of positive cash flow, we could obviously buy back shares.
Alex Potter: All right. That's actually all very helpful context. Thank you. Maybe one final question and I'll pass it on. OpEx reductions, thank you for quantifying the impact there. I'd be interested also in potentially more qualitative discussion of what the implications are for these headcount reductions. What are the types of activities that you're presumably sacrificing as a result of parting ways with these folks? Thanks very much.
Vaibhav Taneja: So like we said, we've done these headcount reductions across the board. And as companies grow over time, there are certain redundancies. There's some duplication of efforts, which happens in certain areas. So you need to go back and look at where all these pockets are, get rid of it. So we're basically going through that exercise wherein we're like, hey, how do we set this company right for the next phase of growth. And the way to think about it is any tree which grows, it needs pruning. This is the pruning exercise which we went through. And at the end of it, we'll be much stronger and much more resilient to deal with the future because the future is really bright. Like I said in my opening remarks, we just have to get through this period and get there.
Elon Musk: Yes, we're not giving up anything that is significant that I'm aware of. So we've had a long period of prosperity from 2019 to now. And so if a company sort of organizationally is 5% wrong per year, that accumulates to 25%, 30% of inefficiency. We've made some corrections along the way. But it is time to reorganize the company for the next phase of growth and you really need to reorganize it, just like a human when we start off with one cell and kind of zygote, blastocyst and you start growing arms and legs and briefly, you have a tail. And so…
Alex Potter: But you shed the tail.
Elon Musk: You shed the tail, hopefully. And then you're baby, you basically, you have to be the organism – a company is kind of like creature growing. And if you don't reorganize it for different phases of growth, it will fail. You can't have the same organizational structure if you're 10 cells versus 100 cells versus 1 million cells versus 1 billion cells versus 1 trillion cells. Humans are around 35 trillion cells, doesn't feel like it feels like, like one person. But you're basically a walking cell colony of roughly 35 trillion depending on your body mass and about three times that number in bacteria. So anyway, you've got to reorganize the company for a new phase of growth or will fail to achieve that growth.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Mark please go ahead and unmute.
Mark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the question. The company previously characterized potential FSD licensing discussions in the early phase and some OEMs had not really been believing in it. Can you elaborate on how much the licensing business opportunity you mentioned today has progressed? And is there anything Tesla needs to achieve with the technology in terms of product milestones in order to be successful at reaching a licensing agreement in your view?
Elon Musk: Well, I think we just need to – it just needs to be obvious that our approach is the right approach. And I think it is. I think we've now with 12.3, if you just have the car drive you around; it is obvious that our solution with a relatively low-cost inference computer and standard cameras can achieve self-driving. No LiDARs, no radars, no ultrasonic nothing.
Vaibhav Taneja: No heavy integration work for vehicle manufacturers.
Elon Musk: Yes. So it really just be a case of having them use the same cameras and inference computer and licensing our software. But once it becomes obvious that if you don't have this in a car, nobody wants your car. It's a smart car. I still remember in, back when Nokia was king of the hill, Yes, crushing. And they certainly come out with a smartphone that was basically a break with limited functionality. And then the iPhone and Android, people still do not understand that all the phones are going to be that way. There's not going to be any flip [ph] phones. If there will be a niche product.
Lars Moravy: Or home phones.
Elon Musk: Yes, no even exactly. When is the last time you saw a home phone.
Lars Moravy: No idea in a hotel, sometimes in hotels.
Elon Musk: Yes, the hotels have them. Yes. So the people don't understand all cars will need to be smart cars, or you will not sell or the car will not – nobody would buy it. Once that becomes obvious, I think licensing becomes not optional.
Mark Delaney: It becomes a method of survival?
Elon Musk: Yes, absolutely, it is. License it or nobody will buy your car.
Vaibhav Taneja: I mean one other thing which I'll add is in the conversations, which we've had with some of these OEMs, I just want to also point out that they take a lot of time in their product life cycle.
Elon Musk: Yes.
Vaibhav Taneja: They're talking about years before they will put it in their product. We might have a licensing deal earlier than that, but it takes a while. So this is where the big difference between us and them is, right?
Elon Musk: Yes, I mean, really a deal signed now would result in it being in a car probably three years.
Vaibhav Taneja: That would be early.
Elon Musk: Yes. That's like lightening basically.
Lars Moravy: That's in eager [ph] OEM.
Elon Musk: Yes. So I wouldn't be surprise if we do sign a deal. I think we have a good chance we do sign a deal this year, maybe more than one. But yes, it would be probably three years before it's integrated with a car. Even though all you need is cameras and our inference computer. So just talking about a massive design change.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes. And again, just to clarify, it's not the work which we have to do. It's the work which they have to do, which will take the time.
Elon Musk: Yes.
Vaibhav Taneja: Mark, is it helpful?
Mark Delaney: Yes, very helpful. Thank you. My follow-up was to better understand Tesla's approach to pricing going forward. Previously, the company had said that the price reductions were driving incremental demand with how affordable the cars have become, especially for vehicles that have access to IRA credits and some of the leasing offers that Tesla has in place. Do you still see meaningful incremental price reductions as making sense from here for the existing products? And can the company meaningfully lower prices from here and also stay free cash flow positive on an annual basis with the current product set? Thanks.
Elon Musk: Yes. I think we can be free cash flow positive meaningfully.
Lars Moravy: I think Vaibhav said it in his opening remarks, like our cost down efforts, we basically were offsetting the price cut like we’re trying to give it back to the customers.
Elon Musk: Yes. I mean the end of the day, like for any given company, if you sell a great product at a great price – if you have a great product at a great price, the sales will be excellent. That’s true of any area. So over time, we do need to keep making sure that we’re – that it’s a great product at a great price. And moreover, that price is accessible to people. So it’s not – you have to solve both the value for money and the fundamental affordability question. The fundamental affordability question is sometimes overlooked. If somebody is earning several hundred thousand dollars a year, they don’t think of a car from a fundamental affordability standpoint. But from vast majority of people are living paycheck to paycheck. So it actually makes a difference if the cost per month for lease refinancing is $10 one way or the other. So it is important to keep improving the affordability and to keep making the price.
Lars Moravy: More accessible.
Elon Musk: Yes, exactly. Make the price more accessible, the value for money better, and to keep improving that over time.
Lars Moravy: But also make kick as cost that people want to buy.
Elon Musk: Yes, it’s going to be a great product and at a great price. And the standards for what constitutes great product at a great price keep increasing. So there’s like – you can’t just be static. You have to keep making the car better, improving the price, but improving the cost of production, and that’s what we’re doing.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes. And in fact, like I said in my opening remarks also, like the revised – the updated Model 3 is a fantastic car. I don’t think people fully even understand that lot of engineering effort which has gone and Lars and team have actually put out videos explaining how much the car is different. I mean it looks and feels different. Not only it looks and feels different. We’ve added so much value to it, but you can lease it for like as low as $299 a month.
Lars Moravy: Without gas.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes.
Martin Viecha: All right. The next question comes from George from Canaccord. George, please go ahead and unmute.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thank you for taking my question. First, could you please help us understand some of the timing of launching FSD in additional geographies, including maybe clarifying your recent comment about China? Thank you.
Elon Musk: I mean like new markets, yes, we are – there are a bunch of markets where we don’t currently sell cars that we should be selling cars in. We’ll see some acceleration of that.
Unidentified Analyst: And FSD new markets?
Elon Musk: Yes. So think about the end-to-end neural net-based autonomy is that just like a human, it actually works pretty well without modification in almost any market. So we plan on – with the approval of the regulators, releasing it as a supervised autonomy system in any market that – where we can get regulatory approval for that, which we think includes China. So yes, it’s – just like a human, you can go rent a car in a foreign country and you can drive pretty well. Obviously, if you live in that country, you’ll drive better. And so we’ll make the car drive better in these other countries with country-specific training. But it can drive quite well almost everywhere.
Vaibhav Taneja: The basics of driving are basically same everywhere like car is a car, the traffic lights, road is the road. Yes.
Elon Musk: It understands that it shouldn’t hit things, no matter what the road rules are.
Vaibhav Taneja: Exactly. There are some road rules that you need to follow. And in China, you shouldn’t cross over a solid line to do a lane change. In U.S. it’s a recommendation I think. In China, you get fined heavily if you do that. We have to do some more actions, but it’s mostly smaller reduction. It’s not like the entire change or type or something.
Elon Musk: Yes.
Martin Viecha: Hey, George, do you have a follow-up?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. So my follow-up has to do with the first quarter deliveries and I’m curious as to whether or not you feel that supply constraints that you mentioned throughout the release impacted the results and maybe can you help us quantify that? And is that why you have some confidence in unit growth in 2024?
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes. I think we did cover this a little bit in the opening remarks to you. Q1 had a lot of different things which are happening. Seasonality was a big one, continued pressure from the macroeconomic environment. We had attacks at our factory. We had Red Sea attacks, we are ramping Model 3, we’re ramping Cybertruck. All these things are happening. I mean, it almost feels like a culmination of all those activities in a constrained period. And that gives us that confidence that, hey, we don’t expect these things to recur.
Elon Musk: Yes. We think Q2 will be a lot better.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes.
Lars Moravy: It’s just one thing after another. Our Cybertrucks are crazy. Thank you.
Elon Musk: Yes, exactly. It’s just – if you’ve got cars that are sitting on ships, they obviously cannot delivered to people. And if you’ve got the excess demand for Model 3 and Model Y in one market, but you don’t have it there. It’s quite a – it’s extremely complex logistics situation. So I’d say also the – we did overcomplicate the sales process, which we’ve just in the past week or so have greatly simplified. So it became far too complex to buy a Tesla, whereas it should just be you can buy the car in under a minute. So we’re getting back to that you can buy a Tesla in under an minute interface from what was quite complex.
Martin Viecha: Okay, thank you. Let’s go to Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Colin, go ahead and unmute, please.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Given the pursuit of Tesla really as a leader in AI for the physical world, in your comments around distributed inference, can you talk about what that approach is unlocking beyond what’s happening in the vehicle right now?
Elon Musk: Do you want to say something?
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes. Like Elon mentioned like the car even when it's a full robotaxi it's probably going to be used 150 hours a week.
Elon Musk: That's my guess like a third of the hours of the week.
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes. It could be more or less, but then there's certainly going to be some hours left for charging and cleaning and maintenance in that world, you can do a lot of other workloads, even right now we are seeing, for example, these LLM companies have these like batch workloads where they send a bunch of documents and those run through pretty large neural networks and take a lot of compute to chunk through those workloads. And now that we have already paid for this compute in these cars, it might be wise to use them and not let them be idle, be like buying a lot of expensive machinery and leaving to them idle. Like we don't want that, we want to use the computer as much as possible and close to like basically 100% of the time to make it a use of it.
Elon Musk: That’s right. I think it's analogous to Amazon Web Services, where people didn't expect that AWS would be the most valuable part of Amazon when it started out as a bookstore. So that was on nobody's radar. But they found that they had excess compute because the compute needs would spike to extreme levels for brief periods of the year and then they had idle compute for the rest of the year. So then what should they do to pull that excess compute for the rest of the year? That's kind of...
Ashok Elluswamy: Monetize it
Elon Musk: Yes, monetize it. So, it seems like kind of a no-brainer to say, okay, if we've got millions and then tens of millions of vehicles out there where the computers are idle most of the time that we might well have them do something useful.
Ashok Elluswamy: Exactly.
Elon Musk: And then, I mean, if you get like to the 100 million vehicle level, which I think we will, at some point, get to, then – and you've got a kilowatt of useable compute and maybe your own hardware 6 or 7 by that time. Then you really – I think you could have on the order of 100 gigawatts of useful compute, which might be more than anyone more than any company, probably more than a company.
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes, probably because it takes a lot of intelligence to drive the car anyway. And when it's not driving the car, you just put this intelligence to other uses, solving scientific problems or answer in terms of someone else.
Elon Musk: It's like a human, ideally. We've already learned about deploying workloads to these nodes
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes. And unlike laptops and our cell phones, it is totally under Tesla's control. So it's easier to distribute the workload across different nodes as opposed to asking users for permission on their own cell phones to be very tedious.
Elon Musk: Well, you're just draining the battery on the phone.
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes, exactly. The battery is also...
Elon Musk: So like technically, I suppose like Apple would have the most amount of distributed compute, but you can't use it because you can't get the – you can't just run the phone at full power and drain the battery.
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes.
Elon Musk: So, whereas for the car, even if you're a kilowatt level inference computer, which is crazy power compared to a phone. If you've got 50 or 60 kilowatt hour pack, it's still not a big deal to run if you are plugged it – whether you plugged it or not – you could be plugged in or not like you could run for 10 hours and use 10-kilowatt hours of your kilowatt of compute power.
Lars Moravy: Yes. We got built in like liquid cold thermal management.
Elon Musk: Yes, exactly.
Lars Moravy: Exactly for data centers, it's already there in the car.
Elon Musk: Exactly. Yes. Its distributed power generation – distributed access to power and distributed cooling, that was already paid for.
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes. I mean that distributed power and cooling, people underestimate that costs a lot of money.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes. And the CapEx is shared by the entire world sort of everyone wants a small chunk, and they get a small profit out of it, maybe.
Elon Musk: Yes.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much guys. And just my follow-up is a little bit more mundane. Looking at the 4680 ramp, can you talk about how close you were to target yields and when you might start to accelerate incremental capacity expansions on that technology?
Elon Musk: We're making good progress on that. But I don't think it's super important for at least in the near term. As Lars said, we think it will be exceed the competitiveness of suppliers by the end of this year and then we'll continue to improve.
Lars Moravy: Yes. I mean, I think it's important to note also that like the ramp right now is relevant to the Cybertruck ramp.
Elon Musk: Yes.
Lars Moravy: And so like we're not going to just randomly build 4680s unless we have a place to put them and so we're going to make sure we're prudent about that. But we also have a lot of investments with all our cell suppliers and vendors. They're great partners, and they've done great development work with us and a lot of the advancements in technologies and chemistry we found 4680, they're also putting into their cells.
Elon Musk: Yes. I mean a big part of the 4680, Tesla doing internal cells was a hedge against what would happen with our suppliers because for a while they are it was very difficult because every big carmaker put in massive battery orders, and so the price per kilowatt hour of lithium-ion batteries went to crazy numbers, crazy levels.
Vaibhav Taneja: Bonkers.
Elon Musk: Yes, just bonkers. So like, okay, we've got to have some hedge here to deal with cost per kilowatt hours of numbers that were double what we anticipated. If we have an internal cell production, then we have that hedge against demand shocks, we have too much demand. That's really the way to think about it. It's not like we want to take on a whole bunch of problems just for the hell of it. We did the cell program in order to address the crazy increase in cost per kilowatt hour from our suppliers due to gigantic orders placed by every carmaker on earth.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Thank you. And the last question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird. Ben, go ahead and unmute. Ben, you're still muted.
Elon Musk: Well, I want to say again, we'd just like to strongly recommend that anyone who is, I guess, thinking about the Tesla stock should really drive FSD 12.3. It really – you can't – it's impossible to understand the company if you do not do this.
Martin Viecha: All right. So since Ben is not unmuting. Let's try Shreyas Patil from Wolfe Research. Final question.
Shreyas Patil: Thanks so much. Just Elon, during the Investor Day last year, you mentioned that auto COGS per unit for the next-gen vehicle would decline by 50% versus the current three and Y. I think that was implying something around $20,000 of COGS. About one-third of that was coming from the on-box manufacturing process. But I'm curious if you see an opportunity that the – some of the other drivers around powertrain cost reduction or material cost savings, would those be largely transferable to some of the new products that you're now talking about introducing?
Lars Moravy: Yes, sure. I mean, in short, yes, I mean, like the on-box manufacturing method is certainly great and revolutionary, but with it comes some risks because new production lines and not, but all the subsystems we developed, whether it was powertrains, drive units, battery improvements in manufacturing and automation, thermal systems, seating, integration of interior components and reduction of LV controllers, all that's transferable, and that's what we're doing, trying to get it in their products as fast as possible. And so yes, that engineering work, we're not trying to just throw it away and put a cars and we're going to take it and utilize it and utilize it to the best advantage of the cars we make and the future cars make.
Shreyas Patil: Okay. Great. And then just on that topic of 4680 cells, I know you mentioned it, you really thought of it more as like a hedge against rising battery costs from other OEMs. But it seems even today, it seems like you would have a cost advantage against some of those other automakers. And I'm wondering, given the rationalizing of your vehicle manufacturing plans that you're talking about now, if there's an opportunity to maybe convert the 4680 cells and maybe sell those to other automakers and really generate an additional revenue stream. I'm just curious if you have any thoughts about that.
Elon Musk: Great. What seems to be happening is that the I'm missing something, the orders for batteries from other automakers have declined dramatically. So we're seeing much more competitive prices for sales from our suppliers, dramatically more competitive than in the past. It is clear that a lot of our suppliers have excess capacity.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes. In addition to what Elon, this is kind of in addition to what Elon said, about 4680, what 4680 did for us from a supply chain perspective was help us understand the supply chain that's upstream of our cell suppliers. So a lot of the deals that we had struck for 4680, we can also supply those materials to our partners, help reducing the overall cost back to Tesla. So we're basically inserting ourselves in the upstream supply chain by doing that. So that's also been beneficial in reducing the overall pricing in addition to the excess capacity that these suppliers have.
Elon Musk: Yes. No, I mean this is going to wax and wane, obviously. So there's going to be a boom and bust in battery cell production where production exceeds supply and then supply exceeds production and back and forth kind of like, I don't know, DRAM or something. But Yes. So it's like what is true today will not be true in the future, there's going to be somewhat of a boom and bust cycle here. And then there are additional complications with government incentives like the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, Joe [ph] has found like a funny name.
Vaibhav Taneja: Comical name.
Elon Musk: Yes, it is like Irish Republican Army, The Internet Research Agency from Russia.
Vaibhav Taneja: Independent retirement account.
Elon Musk: Yes, exactly. Roth IRA. It's like Spider-Man situation, which IRA wins. So but it is complicate the incentive structure. So that is there's the stronger demand for cells that are produced in the U.S. than outside the U.S. But then how long is that the IRA last, I don't know.
Vaibhav Taneja: Which is why it's important that we have both internet [ph] cells and vendor cells that hedge against all of this.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Thank you very much. That's all the time we have today. But at the same time, I would like to make a short announcement. And I wanted to let the investment community know that about a month ago, I met up with Elon and Vaibhav and announced that I'll be moving on from the world of Investor Relations. I'll be hanging around for another couple of months or so. So feel free to reach out at any time. But after the seven year sprint, I'm going to be taking a break and spending some good quality time with my family. And I wanted to say that these seven years have been the greatest privilege of my professional life. I'll never forget the memories from I started literally at the beginning of production hell and just watching the company from the inside to see what it's become today. And especially super thankful to the people in this room and dozens of people outside of this room that I've worked for over the years. I think the team's strength and teamwork at Tesla is unlike anything else I've seen in my career. Elon, thank you very much for this opportunity that I got back in 2017. Thank you for seeking investor feedback and regularly and debating it with me.
Elon Musk: Yes. Well, I mean the reason I reached out to you was because I thought your analysis of Tesla was the best that I had seen.
Martin Viecha: Thank you.
Elon Musk: So, thank you for helping Tesla to get to where it is today over seven years. It's been a pleasure working with you.
Martin Viecha: Thank you so much. And yes, thank you for all the thousands of shareholders that we've met over the years and walked around factories and loved all the interactions, even the tough ones. And yes, looking forward to the call in the next three months, but I'll be on the other side, listening in. Thank you very much.

2024,Q2,2024-07-24,"Travis Axelrod: Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Tesla's Second Quarter 2024 Q&A Webcast. My name is Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations and I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives. Our Q2 results were announced at about 3.00 p.m. Central Time and the Update Deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?
Elon Musk: Thank you. So to recap, we saw large adoption exploration in EVs, and then a bit of a hangover as others struggle to make compelling EVs. So there are quite a few competing electric vehicles that have entered the market. And mostly they’ve not done well, but they’ve discounted their EVs very substantially, which has made it a bit more difficult for Tesla. We don’t see this as long-term issue, but really -- fairly short-term. And we still obviously firmly believe that EVs are best for customers and that the world is headed for a fully electrified transport, not just the cars, but also aircrafts and boats. Despite many challenges the Tesla team did a great job executing and we did achieve record quarterly revenues. Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q2, leading to record profits for the energy business. And we are investing in many future projects, including AI training and inference and great deal of infrastructure to support future products. We won't get too much into the product roadmap here, because that is reserved for product announcement events. But we are on track to deliver a more affordable model in the first half of next year. The big -- really by far the biggest differentiator for Tesla is autonomy. In addition to that, we've scale economies and we're the most efficient electric vehicle producer in the world. So, this, anyway -- while others are pursuing different parts of the AI robotic stack, we are pursuing all of them. This allows for better cost control, more scale, quicker time to market, and a superior product, applying not to -- not just to autonomous vehicles, but to autonomous humanoid robots like Optimus. Regarding Full Self-Driving and Robotaxi, we've made a lot of progress with Full Self-Driving in Q2 and with version 12.5 beginning rollout, we think customers will experience a step change improvement in how well supervised full self-driving works. Version 12.5 has 5x the parameters of 12.4 and will finally merge the highway and city stacks. So the highway stack is still at this point is pretty old. So often the issues people encounter are on highway, but with 12.5, we are finally merged the two stacks. I still find that most people actually don't know how good the system is, and I would encourage anyone to understand the system better, to simply try it out and let the car drive you around. One of the things we're going to be doing just to make sure people actually understand the capabilities of the car is when delivering a new car and when picking up a car for service to just show people how to use it and just drive them around the block. Once people use it at all they tend to continue using it. So it's very compelling. And then this I think will be a massive demand driver, even unsupervised full self-driving will be a massive demand driver. And as we increase the miles between intervention, it will transition from supervised full self-driving to unsupervised full self-driving, and we can unlock massive potential in [V3] (ph). We postponed the sort of Robotaxi the sort of product unveil by a couple of months where it were -- it shifted to 10/10 to the 10th October -end because I wanted to make some important changes that I think would improve the vehicle -- sort of Robotaxi, the thing that we are -- the main thing that we are going to show and we are also going to show off a couple of other things. So moving it back a few months allowed us to improve the Robotaxi as well as add in a couple other things for the product unveil. We're also nearing completion of the South expansion of Giga Texas, which will house our largest training cluster to date. So it will be an incremental for 50,000 H100s plus 20,000 of our hardware 4 AI5 Tesla AI computer. With Optimus, Optimus is already performing tasks in our factory. And we expect to have Optimus production Version 1 in limited production starting early next year. This will be for Tesla consumption. It's just better for us to iron out the issues ourselves. But we expect to have several thousand Optimus robots produced and doing useful things by the end of next year in the Tesla factories. And then in 2026, ramping up production quite a bit, and at that point we'll be providing Optimus robots to outside customers. That will be Production Version 2 of Optimus. For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else. This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained. So we are ramping up production in our U.S. factory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially. So in conclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board. We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy. The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright. I really just can't emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus. Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet. And it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number. ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $5 trillion, I think they are probably not wrong. And long-term Optimus, I think, it achieves a valuation several times that number. I want to thank the Tesla team for a strong execution and looking forward to exciting years ahead.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you very much, Elon, and Vaibhav has opening remarks as well.
Vaibhav Taneja: Thanks. As Elon mentioned, the Tesla team rose to the occasion yet again and delivered on all fronts with some notable records. In addition to those records, we saw our automotive deliveries go sequentially. I would like to thank the entire Tesla team for their efforts in delivering a great quarter. On the auto business front, affordability remains a top of mind for customers, and in response in Q2, we offered attractive financing options to offset sustained high interest rates. These programs had an impact on revenue per unit in the quarter. These impacts will persist into Q3 as we have already launched similar programs. We are now offering extremely competitive financing rates in most parts of the world. This is the best time to buy a Tesla, I mean, if you are waiting on the sidelines, come out and get your car. We had a record quarter on regulatory credits, revenues, and as well. On net, our auto margins remained flat sequentially. It is important to note that the demand for regulatory credits is dependent on other OEMs plans for the kind of vehicles they are manufacturing and selling as well as changes in regulations. We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories. As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price. We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than 300 miles on a single charge. We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range anxiety. Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we've seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further. Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck. While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such reductions would show up in the P&L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered. Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping Cybertruck and Model 3 and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished goods. While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the near-term. We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was laid over time is bearing the expected results. Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting in record revenues and profit for the energy business. Energy storage backlog is strong. As discussed before, deployments will fluctuate from period to period with some quarters seeing large increases and others seeing a decline. Recognition of storage gigawatt hours is dependent on a variety of factors, including logistics timing as we send units from a single factory to markets across the world, customer readiness and in case of EPC projects on construction activities. Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved sequentially from the improvement in service utilization and growth in our collision repair business. The impact of our recent reorg is reflected in restructuring other - on the income statement. Just to level set, this was about $622 million of charge, which got recorded in the period. And I want people to remember that we've called it out separately on the financials. Sequentially, our operating expenses excluding surcharges reduced despite an increase in spend for AI-related activities and higher legal and other costs. On the CapEx front, while we saw a sequential decline in Q2, we still expect the year to be over $10 billion in CapEx as we increase our spend to bring a 50k GPU cluster online. This new cluster will immensely increase our capabilities to scale FSD and other AI initiatives. We reverted to positive free cash flow of $1.3 billion in Q2. This was despite restructuring payments being made in the quarter and we ended the quarter with over $30 billion of cash and investments. Once again, we've begun the journey towards the next phase for the company with the building blocks being placed. It will take some time, but will be a rewarding experience for everyone involved. Once again, I would like to thank the entire Tesla team for their efforts.
A - Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you very much, Vaibhav. Now let's go to investor questions. The first question is, what is the status on the Roadster?
Elon Musk: With respect to Roadster, we've completed most of the engineering. And I think there's still some upgrades we want to make to it, but we expect to be in production with Roadster next year. It will be something special, like the whole thing [Indiscernible].
Travis Axelrod: Fantastic. The next question is about timing of Robotaxi event, which we've already covered. So we'll go to the next question, when do you expect the first Robotaxi ride?
Elon Musk: I guess that, that's really just a question of when can we expect the first -- or when can we do unsupervised full self-driving. It's difficult, obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past. So I mean, based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high enough that -- to be far enough in excess of humans that you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year. I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year. So next year seems highly probable to me based on [quite simply] (ph) plus the points of the curve of miles between intervention. That trend exceeds humans for sure next year, so yes.
Travis Axelrod: Thank you very much. Our third question is, the Cybertruck is an iconic product that wows everyone who sees it. Do you have plans to expand the cyber vehicle lineup to a cyber SUV or cyber van?
Elon Musk: I think we want to limit product announcements to when we have a special -- specific product announcement event, rather than earnings calls.
Travis Axelrod: Great, thank you. Our next question is, what is the current status of 4680 battery cell production and how is the ramp up progressing?
Lars Moravy: Yes, 4680 production ramped strongly in Q2, delivering 51% more cells than Q1 while reducing COGS significantly. We currently produce more than 1,400 Cybertrucks of 4680 cells per week, and we'll continue to ramp output as we drive cost down further towards the cost parity target we set for the end of the year. We've built our first validation Cybertruck with dry cathode process made on our mass production equipment, which is a huge technical milestone and we're super proud of that. We're on track for production launch with dry cathode in Q4, and this will enable cell cost to be significantly below available alternatives, which was the original goal of the 4680 program.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you very much. The next question is any update on Dojo?
Elon Musk: Yes, so Dojo, I should preface this by saying I'm incredibly impressed by NVIDIA's execution and the capability of their hardware. And what we are seeing is that the demand for NVIDIA hardware is so high that it's often difficult to get the GPUs. And there just seems this, I guess I'm quite concerned about actually being able to get state-of-the-art NVIDIA GPUs when we want them. And I think this therefore requires that we put a lot more effort on Dojo in order to have -- in order to ensure that we've got the training capability that we need. So we are going to double down on Dojo, and we do see a path to being competitive with NVIDIA with Dojo. And I think we kind of have no choice because the demand for NVIDIA is so high and the -- it's obviously their obligation essentially to raise the price of GPUs to whatever the market will bear, which is very high. So, I think we've really got to make Dojo work and we will.
Travis Axelrod: Right. The next question is what type of accessories will be offered with Optimus?
Elon Musk: There's -- Optimus is intended to be a generalized humanoid robot with a lot of intelligence. So it's like saying what kind of accessories will be offered with a human. It's just really intended to be able to be backward compatible with human tasks. So it would use any accessories that a human would use. Yes.
Travis Axelrod: Thank you. The next question is, do you feel you're cheating people out of the joys of owning a Tesla by not advertising?
Elon Musk: We are doing some advertising, so, want to say something?
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes, I would say something. Our fundamental belief is that we need to be providing the best products at a reasonable price to the consumers. Just to give you a fact, in U.S. alone in Q2, over two-thirds of our sales were to -- deliveries were to people who had never owned a Tesla before and which is encouraging. We've spent money on advertising and other awareness programs and we have adjusted our strategy. We're not saying no to advertising, but this is a dynamic play and we know that we have not exhausted all our options and therefore plan to keep adjusting, but in the latter half of this year as well.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you very much. The next question is on energy growth, which we already covered in opening remarks, so we'll move on to the next one. What is the updated timeline for Giga Mexico and what will be the primary vehicles produced initially?
Elon Musk: Well, we currently are paused on Giga Mexico. I think we need to see just where things stand after the election. Trump has said that he will put heavy tariffs on vehicles produced in Mexico. So it doesn't make sense to invest a lot in Mexico if that is going to be the case. So we kind of need to see where the things play out politically. However, we are increasing capacity at our existing factories quite significantly. And I should say that the Cybertaxi or Robotaxi will be produced here at our headquarters at Giga Texas.
Travis Axelrod: All right. Thank you.
Elon Musk: And as well Optimus towards the end of next year for Optimus production Version 2, the high volume version of Optimus will also be produced here in Texas.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you. Just a couple more. Is Tesla still in talks with an OEM to license FSD?
Elon Musk: There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla full self-driving. And I suspect there will be more over time. But we can't comment on the details of those discussions.
Travis Axelrod: All right. Thank you. And the last one, any updates on investing in xAI and integrating Grok into Tesla software?
Elon Musk: I should say Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI. It's been actually helpful in advancing full self-driving and in building up the new Tesla data center. With -- regarding investing in xAI, I think, we need to have a shareholder approval of any such investment. But I'm certainly supportive of that if shareholders are, the group -- probably, I think we need a vote on that. And I think there are opportunities to integrate Grok into Tesla's software, yes.
Travis Axelrod: All right. Thanks very much. And now we will move on to analyst questions. The first question comes from Will Stein from Truist. Will, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
Will Stein: Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. And this relates a little bit to the last one that was asked. Elon, I share your strong enthusiasm about AI and I recognize Tesla's opportunity to do some great things with the technology. But there are some concerns I have about Tesla's commercialization and that's what I'd like to ask about specifically. There were some news stories through the quarter that indicated that you redirected some AI compute systems that were destined for Tesla instead to xAI or perhaps it was to X, I'm not sure. And similarly, a few quarters ago, if you recall, I asked about your ability to hire engineers in this area, and you noted that there was a great desire for some of these engineers to work on projects that you were involved with, but some of them weren't at Tesla, they were instead at xAI or perhaps even X again. So the question is, when it comes to your capital investments, your AI R&D, your AI engineers, how do you make allocation decisions among these various ventures and how do you make Tesla owners comfortable that you're doing it in a way that really benefits them? Thank you.
Elon Musk: Yes, I mean, I think you're referring to a very -- like an old article, regarding GPUs. I think that's like 6 or 7 months old. At Tesla, we had no place to try them on, so it would've been a waste of Tesla capital because we would just have to order H100 and have no place to try them on. So it was just -- there was -- this wasn't a, let's pick xAI of Tesla. There's -- there was no -- the Tesla data centers were full. There was no place to actually put them. The -- we've been working 24/7 to complete the South extension on the Tesla Giga factory in Texas. That South extension is what will house 50,000 H100s and we're beginning to move the H100 server racks into place there. But we really needed -- we needed that to complete physically. You can't just order compute -- order GPUs and turn them on, you need a data center, it's not possible. So I want to be clear, that was in Tesla's interest, not contrary to Tesla's interest. Does Tesla no good to have GPUs that it can't turn on. That South extension is able to take GPUs, which is really just this week. We are moving the GPUs in there and we'll bring them online. With regard to xAI, there are a few that only want to work on AGI. So what I was finding was that when trying to recruit people to Tesla, they were only interested in working on AGI and not on Tesla's specific problems and they want to start -- do a start-up. So it was a case of either they go to a start-up or -- and I am involved or they do a start-up and I am not involved. Those are the two choices. This wasn't they would come to Tesla. They were not going to come to Tesla under any circumstances. So, yes.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes, I mean, I would even add that AI is a broad spectrum and there are a lot of things which we are focused on full time driving as Tesla and also Optimus, but there's the other spectrum of AI which we're not working on, and that's the kind of work which other companies are trying to do in this case, xAI. So you have to keep that in mind that it's a broad spectrum. It's not just one specific thing.
Elon Musk: Yes. And once again, I want to just repeat myself here. I tried to recruit them to Tesla, including to say like, you can work on AGI, I if you want and they refused. Only then was xAI created.
Will Stein: I really appreciate that clarification. If I can ask one follow-up, it relates to the new vehicles that you're planning to introduce next year. I understand this is not the venue for product announcements, but when we think about the focus, I've heard on the one hand that the focus is on cost reduction. On the other hand, you also said that the Roadster would come out. Should we expect other maybe more limited variants like, similar to the cars that you make today, but with some changes or improvements or different, some other variability in the form factors. It should -- we expect that to be a significant part of the strategy in the next year or two?
Elon Musk: I don't want to get into details of product announcements. And we have to be careful of the Osborne effect here. So, if you start announcing some great thing, it affects our near-term sales. We're going to make great products in future just like we have in the past, end of story.
Travis Axelrod: Right. The next question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird. Ben, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
Ben Kallo: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. When we think about revenue contribution and with energy growing so quickly and Optimus on the come, how do we think about the overall segments longer term? And then do you think that auto revenue will fall below 50% of your overall revenue? And then my follow-up is just on the last call you talked about, distributed compute on your new hardware. Could you just update us and talk a little bit more about that, the timeline for it and how you would reward customers for letting you use their compute power and their cars? Thanks.
Elon Musk: Yes, I mean, as I've said a few times, I think the long-term value of Optimus will exceed that of everything else that Tesla combined. So, it's simply -- just simply consider the usefulness utility of a humanoid robot that can do pretty much anything you ask of it. I think everyone on earth is going to want one. There's 8 billion people on earth, so it's 8 billion right there. Then you've got, all of the industrial uses, which is probably at least as much, if not way more. So I suspect that the long-term demand for general purpose humanoid robots is in excess of 20 billion units. And Tesla is -- that has the most advanced humanoid robot in the world, and is also very good at manufacturing, which these other companies are not. And we've got a lot of experience -- with the most experienced with the world leaders in real world AI. So we have all of the ingredients. I think we are unique in having all of the ingredients necessary for large scale, high utility, generalized humanoid robots. That's why my rough estimate long-term is in accordance with the ARK [ph] Invest analysis of market cap on the order of $5 trillion for -- maybe more for autonomous transport, and it's several times that number for general purpose humanoid robots. I mean, at that point, I'm not sure what money even means, but in the benign AI scenario, we are headed for an age of abundance where there is no shortage of goods and services. Anyone can have pretty much anything they want. It's a wild -- very wild future we're heading for.
Ben Kallo: On the distributed compute?
Elon Musk: Yes, distributed compute, that seems like a pretty obvious thing to do. I think the -- where this distributed compute becomes interesting is with our next generation Tesla AI truck, which is hardware viable or what we're calling AI5, which is -- from the standpoint of inference capability comparable toB200 -- and a bit of B200. And we are aiming to have that in production at the end of next year and scale production in '26. So it just seemed like if you've got -- even if you've got autonomous vehicles that are operating for 50 or 60 hours a week, there's a 168 hours in a week. So you have somewhere above I think a 100 [indiscernible] net computing. I think we need a better word than GPU because GPU means graph express in unit. So there's a 100 hours plus per week of AI compute, AI advanced compute from the fleet, from the vehicles and probably some percentage from the humanoid robots that it would make sense to do distributed inference. And if you're -- if there's a fleet of at some point a 100 million vehicles with AI5 and beyond, because you have AI 6 and 7 and whatnot, and there may be billions of humanoid robots that is just a staggering amount of inference compute or that could be used for general purposes at computing. It doesn't have to be used for, the humanoid robot or for the car. So I think, that's just -- that -- that's a pretty obvious thing to say, like, well, it's more useful than having to do nothing.
Travis Axelrod: All right. Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Potter from Piper Alex. Alex, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
Alex Potter: Perfect. Thanks. I wanted to ask a question on FSD licensing. You mentioned that in passing previously, was just wondering if you can elaborate maybe on the mechanics of how that would work. I guess presumably this would not be some sort of simple plug and play proposition that presumably an OEM would need, I don't know, several years to develop its own vehicle platform that's based on FSD. I imagine they would need to adopt Tesla's electrical architecture, compute, sensor stack. So I, correct me if I'm sort of misunderstanding this, but if you had a cooperative agreement of some kind with another OEM, then presumably it would take you several years before you'd be able to recognize licensing revenue from that agreement. Is that the right way to think about that?
Elon Musk: Yes. The OEMs not real fast. There's not really a sensor suite, it's just cameras. But they would have to integrate our AI computer and have cameras with a 360 degree view. And at least the gateway, like the what talks to the internet, and communicates with the Tesla system, what that you need kind of a gateway computer too. So it's really gateway computer with the cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity, the Tesla AI computer, and seven cameras, or not cameras, again, a 360 degree view. But this will -- given the speed at which, the auto industry moves, it would be several years before you would see this in volume.
Alex Potter: Okay, good. That's more or less what I expected. So then the follow-up here is, if you did sign an FSD licensing agreement with another automaker, when do you think you would disclose that? Would you do it right when you signed the agreement or only after that multiple years has passed and the vehicle is ready to be rolled out? think it depends on the OEM. I guess we'd be happy either way. Yes, it depends on, what kind of arrangement we enter into. A lot of those things are, we are not resolved yet, so we'll make that determination as and when we get to that point.
Elon Musk: And the kind of deals that are obviously relevant are only if, some OEM is willing to do this in a million cars a year or something significant. It's not -- if it's like 10,000 or a 100,000 cars a year. We can just make that ourselves.
Travis Axelrod: All right, thank you. The next question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays. Dan, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
Dan Levy: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. First, wanted to start with a question on Shanghai. You've leveraged Shanghai as an export center really due its low cost, and that makes sense. But maybe you can just give us a sense of, of how the strategy changes, if at all, given, the implementation of tariffs in Europe. Also to what extent, your import of batteries from China into the U.S., how that might change given the tariffs. Thank you.
Elon Musk: Yes. I think I covered some part of it in my opening remarks, but just to give you a little bit more, just on the tariff side, the European authorities did sample certain other OEMs in the first round to establish the tariffs for cars being imported from China into Europe. While we were not picked up in our individual examination in the first round, they did pick us up in the second round. They visited our factory. They -- we worked with them, provided them all the information. As a result, we were adjusting our import strategy out of China into Europe. But -- and one other thing to note is in Q2 itself, we started building right hand from model wise out of Berlin and we also delivered it in U.K. And we're adjusting as needed, but we will keep adjust. We're still importing Model 3s into Europe, out of Shanghai. And we are still evaluating what is the best alternate manage all this just on the examination by the European authorities. Like I said, we cooperated with them. Well, we are confident that they, we should get a better rate than what they have imposed for now. But this is literally evolving and we are adjusting as fast as we can with this. It is -- I would also add that, because of this, you've seen the impact that Berlin is doing more imports into places like Taiwan as well as, U.K I just mentioned. So it will keep changing and we will keep adapting as we go about it.
Dan Levy: Great. Thanks. Yes, thank you. As a follow-up, wanted to ask about the Robotaxi strategy and specifically the shareholder deck here notes that the release is going to be -- one of the gating factors is regulatory approval. So maybe you could help us understand which regulations specifically are the ones that we should be looking for? Is it FMVSS, that's standard? And then to what extent does the strategy shift? You've done with FSD more of a nationwide, no boundary approach. Is the Robotaxi approach one that's more geofenced, so to speak, and is more driven by a state by state approach?
Elon Musk: I mean, our solution is a generalized solution like what everybody else has. They, if you see like Waymo has one of it, they have a very localized solution that requires high density mapping. It's not -- it's quite fragile. So, their ability to expand rapidly is limited. Our solution is a general solution that works anywhere. It would even work on a different earth. So if you're rendered a new Earth, it would work on a new earth. So it's -- there's this capability I think in our experience, once we demonstrate that something is safe enough or significantly safer than human. We are fine that regulators are supportive of deploying deployment of that capability. It's difficult to argue with if you -- if you've got a large number of -- yes, if you've got billions of miles that show that in the future unsupervised FSD is safer than human. What regulator could really stand in the way of that? They would -- they're morally obligated to approve. So I don't think regulatory approval will be a limiting factor. I should also say that the self-driving capabilities of this are deployed outside of North America are far behind that in, in North America. So with the -- with Version 12.5, and maybe a 12.6, but pretty soon we will ask for regular regulatory approval of the Tesla supervised FSD in Europe, China, and other countries. And I, I think we're likely to receive that before the end of the year, which will be a helpful demand driver in those regions obviously.
Travis Axelrod: Thank you. Just to …
Elon Musk: Go ahead, Travis.
Travis Axelrod: In terms of like, as Elon said, in terms of regulatory approval, the vehicles are governed by FMVSS in U.S., which is the same across all 50 states. The road rules are the same across all 50 states. So creating a generalized solution gives us the best opportunity to deploy in all 50 states, reasonably. Of course there are state and even local and municipal level regulations that may apply to, being a transportation company or deploying taxes. But as far as getting the vehicle on the road, that's all federal and that's very much in line with what you was just suggesting about the data and the vehicle itself.
Vaibhav Taneja: And to add to the technology point, the end-to-end network basically makes no assumption about the location. Like you could add data from different countries and it just like perform equally well there, just like almost like close to zero US specific, um, code in there. It's all just the data that comes from the U.S
Elon Musk: Yes. To, to that end of the show, it's like, we can go as humans to other countries and drive with some reasonable amount of assessment in those countries. And that's how you design the FSC software. Yes, exactly.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thanks guys. The next question comes from George from Canaccord. George, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
George Gianarikas: Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe just to expand on the regulatory question for a second. And I could be comparing apples and oranges, but GM canceled their pedal less, wheel less vehicle. And according to the company this morning, their decision was driven by uncertainty about the regulatory environment. And from what we understand, and again, maybe I'm wrong here, but the Robotaxi that has been shown at least in images of the public is also pedal less and wheel less. Is there a different regulatory concern just if you deploy a vehicle like that that doesn't have pedal -- pedals or a wheel, and that may not be different from just regular FSD on a traditional Tesla vehicle. Thank you.
Elon Musk: Well, obviously the real reason that they cancel it is because GM can't make it work, not because the regulators, they're blaming regulators. That's misleading of them to do so, because Waymo is doing just fine in those markets. So it's just that their technology is not far.
George Gianarikas: Right. And maybe just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned, that FSD take rates were up materially after you reduced the price. Is there any way you can help us quantify what that means Exactly? Thank you.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes, we shared the [indiscernible] that there we've seen a meaningful increase. I don't want to get into specific because we started from a low base and -- but we are seeing encouraging results. And the key thing here is, like Elon said, you need to experience it because words can't describe it till the time we actually use it. And that's why we are trying to make sure that every time a car is getting delivered, people are being showed how this thing is working because when you see it working, you realize how great it is. I mean, just to give you one example, so again, there's a bias example, but I have a more than 20 mile commute into the factory almost every day. I have zero interventions on the latest stack, and the card just literally drives me over. And especially with the latest version wherein, we are also tracking your eye movement, the steering wheel lag is almost not there as long as you're not wearing sunglasses.
Elon Musk: Well, we are fixing the sunglasses thing. It's coming soon. So you will be able to drive -- you'll be able to have sunglasses on and have the car drive.
George Gianarikas: Yes.
Elon Musk: So -- but there's number of times I've talked with smart people who like live in New York or maybe downtown Boston and don't ever drive and then ask me about FSD, I'm like, you can just get a car and try it. And if you're not doing that, you have no idea what's going on.
Travis Axelrod: Thank you. The next question comes from Pierre from New Street. Pierre, please unmute yourself.
Ferragu Pierre: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. So it's on Robotaxi again, and I completely get it that with a universal solution, we will get like regulatory approval, we'll get there eventually clicking up miles and compute, et cetera. And my question is more, how you think about deployments, because I'm still like, I'm thinking once you have a car that can drive everywhere, that can replace me, it can replace a taxi, but then to do the right hailing service, you need a certain scale. And that means a lot of cars on the road and so you need an infrastructure to just maintain the cars, take care of them, et cetera. And so my question is, are you already working on that? Do you have already an idea of what, like your plan to deploy looks like? And is that like a test Tesla only plan or are you looking at partners, local partners, global partners to do that? And I'll have a quick follow-up.
Elon Musk: Yes. This would just be the Tesla network. You just literally open the Tesla app and summon a car and resend a car to pick you up and take you somewhere. And you can -- our -- we'll have a fleet that's I don't know, on order of 7 million dedicated global autonomy soon. In the years come it'll be over 10 million, then over 20 million. This is immense scale. And the car is able to operate 24/7, unlike the human driver. So, the capability to -- like, if there's this basically instant scale with a software update. And now this is for a customer on fleet. So you can think of that as being a bit like Airbnb, like you can choose to allow your car to be used by the fleet, or cancel that and bring it back. It can be used by the fleet all the time. It can be used by the fleet some of the time, and then Tesla would take -- would share on the revenue with the customer. But you can think of the giant fleet of Tesla vehicles as like a giant sort of Airbnb equivalent fleet, Airbnb on wheels. The -- I mean, then in addition we would make some number of cars for Tesla that would just be owned by Tesla and be added to the fleet. I guess that would be a bit more like Uber. But this would all be a Tesla network. And there's an important clause we've put in, in every Tesla purchase, which is that the Tesla vehicles can only be used in the Tesla fleet. They cannot be used by a third-party for autonomy.
Ferragu Pierre: Okay. And do you think that scale is like progressively so you can start in a city with just a handful of cars and you grow the number of cars over time? Or do you think there is like a critical mass you need to get to, to be able to offer like a service that is of competitive quality compared to what like the -- like Uber would be typically delivering already?
Elon Musk: I guess I'm not -- maybe I'm not conveying this correctly. The entire Tesla fleet basically becomes active. This is obviously maybe there's some number of people who don't want their car to own money, but I think most people will. It's instant scale.
Travis Axelrod: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin from Oppenheimer. Colin, please unmute yourself.
Colin Rusch: Sorry about that guys. I've got two questions around energy storage. With the tight supply and the stationary storage, can you talk about your pricing strategy and how you're thinking about saturation and given geographies given that some of these larger systems are starting to shift wholesale power markets in a pretty meaningful way quickly?
Vaibhav Taneja: So, I mean, we are working with a large set of players in the market and our pipeline is actually pretty long. And there's actually very -- there's actually long end in terms of where you enter into a contract where delivery started -- starts happening. And so far we have good pricing leverage. And now Mike, chime in on this too.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, I mean there's a lot of competition from Chinese OEMs just like there is in the vehicle space. So we're in close contact with our customers and making sure that we're remaining competitive in where they're needing to be competitive to, to secure contracts to sell power and energy in the markets. We had a really strong contracting quarter and continue to build our backlog for 2025 and 2026. So we feel pretty good about where we are in the market. We realize that competition is strong, but we have a pretty strong value proposition with offering a fully integrated product with our own power electronics and site level controls. So …
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes, and again, the aspect which people miss do not fully understand is that there's also a whole software stack, which comes with from Megapack, right? And that is a unique proposition which we -- which is only available to us, and we are using it with other stuff too, but that gives us a much more of an edge as compared to the competition.
Elon Musk: Yes, we find customers that they can sort of put together a hodgepodge solution. And so, and then sometimes they'll pick that solution, and then that doesn't work. And then they come back to us.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, and we're not really seeing saturation for like, on a global scale. There's little pockets of saturation in different markets, but we're more seeing that there's markets opening up given demand on the grid just continues to increase more than anyone expects. So that just opens up markets, really across the world in different pockets.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes, I mean just even on the AI computer side, right? These GPUs are really powerful already and the amount of new pipeline, which we're getting for people for data center backup and things like that is increasing at a pretty large scale.
Colin Rusch: Yes. Thanks. And then the follow-up here is 4680 process technology and the role to role process. There's some news around your equipment suppliers. Can you talk about how far along you are in, in potentially qualifying an incremental supplier around some of that, those critical process technology steps?
Lars Moravy: Yes, I can talk about that. As you're probably referring to the lawsuit that we have with one of our suppliers, look, I don't think this is going to affect our ability to roll out 4680. We have very strong IP position in the technology and the majority of the equipment that we use is in-house designed and some of it's in-house build. And so we can take our IP stack and have someone else build it if we need to. So it's, that's not really a concern right now.
Elon Musk: Yes. I, I think people don't understand just how much demand there will be for grid storage. They really just like the [indiscernible] I think are underestimating this demand by probably orders magnitude. So that the actual energy, total energy output of, say the U.S grid is if the power plants can operate a steady state is at least two to three times, the amount of energy it currently produces, because there are a huge gap. There's a huge difference in the -- from peak to trough in terms of energy of power generation. So in order for a grid to not have blackouts, it must be able to support the load at the worst minute of the worst day of the year, the coldest or hottest day, which means that for the rest of the time, the rest of the year, it's got massive excess power generation capability, but it has no way to store that energy. Once you add battery packs, you can now run the power plants at steady state. Steady state means that basically any given grid anywhere in the world can produce in terms of cumulative energy in the course of the year, at least twice what it is currently producing in some cases, maybe three times.
Travis Axelrod: All right. Thank you, Elon. The next question comes from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo. Colin, please unmute yourself.
Colin Langan: Oh, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Do you hear me?
Travis Axelrod: Yes.
Colin Langan: Yes. Sorry. I guess when we are going to ask, if Trump wins, there's a higher chance that IRA could get cut. I think Elon, you had commented online that Tesla doesn't survive on EV subsidies. But when Tesla lose a lot of support if IRA goes away? I think model Y3 and Y get IRA help for customers, and I think your batteries get production tax credits. So, just one, can you clarify if the end, if IRA ends, would it be a negative for your profitability in the near-term? Why might it not be a negative? And then, any framing of the current support you get, IRA-related?
Elon Musk: I guess that there would be like some impact, but I think it would be devastating for our competitors. But -- and it would hurt Tesla slightly. But long-term probably actually helps Tesla would be my guess. Yes -- but I've said this before on earnings calls, it -- the value of Tesla overwhelmingly is autonomy. These other things are in the noise relative to autonomy. So I recommend anyone who doesn't believe that Tesla will solve vehicle autonomy should not hold Tesla stock. They should sell their Tesla stock. You should believe Tesla will solve autonomy, you should buy Tesla stock. And all these other questions are in the noise.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes, I mean, I'll add this just to clarify a few things that -- at the end of the day, when we are looking at our business, we've always been looking at it whether or not IRA is there and we want our business to grow healthy without having any subsidies coming in, whichever way you look at it. And that's the way we have always modeled everything. And that is the way internally also even when we are looking at battery costs, yes, I --, there are manufacturing credits which we get, but we always drive ourselves to say, okay, what if there is no higher benefit and how do we operate in that kind of an environment? And like Elon said, we definitely have a big advantage as compared to a competition on that front. We've delivered it and you can see it in the numbers over the years. Like, so there is you cannot ignore the fundamental size of the business. And then on top of it, once you add autonomy to it, like even said, it becomes meaningless to you think about the short-term.
Travis Axelrod: Okay. I think that's unfortunately all the time we have for today. We appreciate all of your questions. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much and goodbye.
Elon Musk: That's excellent.",split transcript is available for premium subscribers only.,TSLA
2024,Q3,2024-10-23,"Travis Axelrod: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Third Quarter 2024 Q&A webcast. My name is Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations, and I am joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja and a number of other executives. Our Q3 results were announced at about 3 P.M. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?
Elon Musk: Thank you. So to recap, something that [Indiscernible] the industry I've seen year-over-year declines in order volumes in Q3. Tesla at the same time has achieved record deliveries. In fact, I think if you look at EV companies worldwide to the best of my knowledge, no EV company is even profitable. And I'm not - to the best of my knowledge, there was no EV division of any company, of any existing auto company that is profitable. So it is notable that Tesla is profitable despite a very challenging automotive environment. And this quarter actually is a record Q3 for us. So we produced our 7-millionth vehicle actually just yesterday. So congratulations to the teams that made it happen in Tesla. That's staggeringly immense amount of work to make 7million cars. So, let's see. And we also have the energy storage business is growing like wildfire, with strong demand for both Megapack and Powerwall. And as people know, on October 10th, we laid out a vision for an autonomous future that I think is very compelling. So, the Tesla team did a phenomenal job there with actually giving people an opportunity to experience the future, where you have humanoid robots walking among the crowd, not with a canned video presentation or anything, but literally walking among the crowd, serving drinks and whatnot. And we had 50 autonomous vehicles. There were 20 Cybercabs, but there were an additional 30 Model Ys operating fully autonomously the entire night, carrying thousands of peoples [Indiscernible] with no incidents, the entire night. So -- and for those who went there that -- it's worth emphasizing that these the Cybercab had no steering wheel or brake or accelerator pedals. Meaning, there was no -- there's no -- there was no way for anyone to intervene manually even if they wanted to. And the whole night went very smoothly. So, regarding the vehicle business, we are still on-track to deliver more affordable models starting in the first half of 2025. This is I think probably people are wondering what should they assume for vehicle sales growth next year. And at the risk of - to take a bit of risk here, I do want to give some rough estimate, which is I think it's 20% to 30% vehicle growth next year. Notwithstanding negative external events, like if there's some force majeure events, like some big war breaks out or interest rates go sky high or something like that, then we can't overcome massive force majeure events. But I think with our lower cost vehicles with the advent of autonomy something like a 20% to 30% growth next year is my best guess. And then Cybercab reaching volume production in ’26. I do feel confident of Cybercab reaching volume production in ‘26. So just starting production, reaching volume production in ‘26. And that's -- that should be substantial. And we're aiming for at least 2 million units a year of Cybercab. That'll be in more than one factory, but I think it's at least 2 million units a year, maybe 4 million ultimately. So, yeah, these are just my best guesses, but if you ask me my best guesses, that those are my best guesses. The cell 4680 lines, the team is actually doing great work there. The 4680 is rapidly approaching the point where it is the most competitive set. So when you consider the fully landed - the cost of a battery pack, fully landed in the U.S. net of incentives and duties, the 4680 is tracking to be the most competitive. Meaning lower cost [Indiscernible] considered than any other alternative. We're not quite there yet, but we're close to being there, which I think is, extremely exciting. And we've got several - a lot of ideas to go well beyond that. So if I think there's -- if we execute well, the 4680 will have the -- Tesla internally produced cell will be the most cost competitive cell in North America, a testament to a tremendous amount of hard work there by the team. So that's - we'll continue to buy a lot of cells from our competitors. Our intent is not to make to provide to make cells just internally. So I don't want to set off any alarm bells here. We're also increasing substantially our vehicle output and our stationary storage output. So we need a lot of cells. And most of them will still come from suppliers, but I think it is some good news that the Tesla internal cell is likely - is tracking to be the most competitive in the U.S. So with respect to autonomy, as people are experiencing in the cars, really from week-to-week, there are significant improvements in the miles between interventions. So with the new version 12.5, release of full self-driving in Cybertruck, combining the code into a single stack so that the, city driving and the entering the highway driving are one stack, which is a bigger burden for the highway driving. So it's just all neural nets. And the release of Actually Smart Summon. We're trying to have a sense of humor here. And we're also -- so that that's 12.5. Version 13 of FSD is going out soon. Ashok will elaborate more on that later in the call. We expect to see some roughly a 5 or 6 fold improvement in miles between interventions compared to 12.5. And looking at the year as a whole, the improvement in miles between interventions, we think will be at least three orders of magnitude. So that's a very dramatic improvement in the course of the year. And we expect that trend to continue next year. So, the current internal expectation for the Tesla FSD having longer miles between intervention than human is the second quarter of next year, which means it may end up being the third quarter, but it's next - it seems extremely likely to be next year. Ashok. Do you want to add anything?
Ashok Elluswamy: Yeah. miles between critical interventions, yep, like you mentioned, Elon, we already made a 100x improvement with 12.5 from starting of this year. And then with v13 release, we expect to be a 1000x from the beginning - from January of this year on production [Indiscernible] software. And this came in because technology improvements going to end-to-end, having higher frame rate, partly also helped by hardware force, more capabilities, so on. And we hope that we continue to scale the neural network, the data, the training compute, et cetera. By Q2 next year, we should cross over the average human miles per critical intervention, call it collision in that case.
Elon Musk: I mean, that that's just unvarnishing our internal estimate.
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes. Yeah.
Elon Musk: So, that's not sandbagging or anything else. Our internal estimate is Q2 of next year to be safer than human and then to continue with rapid improvements, thereafter. So, a vast majority of humanity has no idea that Teslas drive themselves. So especially for something like a Model 3 or Model Y, it looks like a normal car. So you don't expect normal car to be able to be intelligent enough to drive itself. The Cybercab looks different. Cybertruck looks different. But Model Y and Model 3 look, they're good looking cars, but look, I think, look fairly normal. You don't expect a fairly normal looking car to have the intelligence enough AI to be able to drive itself, but it does. So we do want to expose that to more people. And so we're doing every time we have, a significant improvement in the software, we'll roll out another sort of 30 day trial. So to encourage people to try it again. And we are seeing a significant improvement in adoption. So the take rate for FSD has improved substantially especially after the 10/10 event. So there's no need to wait for a robo-taxi or Cybercab to experience full autonomy. We expect to achieve that next year with the -- with our existing vehicle line.
Ashok Elluswamy : One point Actually Smart Summon gives a small taste of what it's going to look like, the car able to drive itself to the user within private parking lots. Currently, it's speed limited, but then it's going to quickly be increased. And we already had more than 1 million usage [Indiscernible] of Smart Summon.
Elon Musk: Yep. So, and we actually we have, for Tesla employees in the Bay Area, we already are offering a ride-hailing capability. So you can actually with the development app, you can request a ride, and it'll take you anywhere in the Bay Area. We do have a safety driver for now, but the software required to do that, we've developed and I mean, David, do you want to elaborate on that?
Unidentified Company Representative : Yeah. Sure. David, we showed some screenshots of this in the Q1 shareholder deck. And, yeah, this is real. We've been testing it for the better part of the year and, the building blocks that we needed in order to build this functionality and deliver it to production, we've been thinking about working on for years. It just so happens that we've used those building blocks to deliver great features for our customers in the meantime, such as sharing your profile, synchronizing it across cars, so that every single car that you jump into, whether it's another car that you own or a car that somebody's loaned to you or a rental car that you jump into, it looks exactly like yours. Everything's synchronized, seat mirror positions, media navigation, everything is the same. Just what you would expect from, one of our robotaxis. But we gave that functionality to our customers right now because we built it intending for it to be used in the future. We’re releasing that functionality now. All the -- and then cybersecurity that we knew we were going to need to deliver that functionality, sending a navigation to destination from your phone to the vehicle, and so we’re doing that now with the ride-hailing app, but it's something that we've made available to customers for years. Seeing the progress on route in the mobile app, that's something you'll need for the ride-hailing app. But again, we released it in the meantime. So it's not like we're just starting to think about this stuff right now while we're building out the early stages of our ride-hailing network. We've been thinking about this for quite a long time, and we're excited to get the functionality out there.
Elon Musk: Yeah. And we do expect to roll out ride-hailing in California, Texas next year to the public. But not the California is somewhat there's quite a long regulatory approval process. I think we should get approval next year, but it's contingent upon regulatory approval. Texas is a lot faster. So it's, I'd say, like, we're -- we'll definitely have available at Texas, and probably have it available in California subject to regulatory approval. And then -- and maybe some other states actually, next year as well, but at least California and Texas. So that'd be very exciting. There's really a profound change. Tesla becomes more than a sort of vehicle and battery manufacturing company, at that point. So we published our Q3 vehicle safety report, which shows one impact for every 7 million miles of autopilot, that compares to the U.S. average of one crash roughly every 700,000 miles. So it's currently showing a 10x safety improvement relative to the U.S. average. And we continue to expand our AI training capacity to accommodate the needs of both FSD and Optimus. We're currently not a training compute constraint. That's probably the biggest factors that the FSD is actually getting so good that it takes us a while to actually find mistakes. And when you start getting to where it could take 10,000 miles to find a mistake, it takes a while to actually figure out which it is -- is this soccer ball better than -- is soccer ball A better than soccer ball B? It actually takes a while to figure it out because neither one of them are making mistakes, or takes take a long time to make mistakes. So that's actually the single [Indiscernible] based on many factors. How long does it take us to figure out which version is better? So that’s sort of high class problem. Obviously, having a giant fleet is very helpful for breaking this out. And then with Optimus, we show a massive improvement in Optimus's dexterity movement on October 10. And our next-gen, hand and forearm, which has 22 degrees of freedom double - which is double the prior hand and forearm, it's extremely human like. And also it's much better tactile sensing. It's really - I feel confident in saying that we have most advanced humanoid robot by long shot. And we're moreover the only company that really has all of the ingredients necessary to scale humanoid robots. Because the things that what other companies are missing is that they're missing the AI brain, and they're missing the ability to really scale to very high volume production. So some have seen some impressive video demos, but what but they’re [lacking is] (ph) localized AI and the [going] (ph) to scale volume to very high numbers. As I've said on a few occasions before, I think Optimus will ultimately be the most valuable product. So I think it has a good chance of being the most valuable product ever made. For the energy business, that's doing extremely well. And there's the opportunity ahead is gigantic. The Lathrop Megapack factory, reached 200 Megapacks a week, which is now a 40 gigawatt hour a year run rate. And, we have a second factory in Shanghai that will begin with a 20 gigawatt hour a year run rate in Q1 next year, so next quarter. And, that will also scale up. It won't be long before, we're shipping a 100 gigawatt hours a year, stationary storage at Tesla. And that'll ultimately grow I think to multiple terawatt hours per year. It has to actually in order to have a sustainable energy future. If you're not at the terawatt scale, you're not really moving the needle. So if you look at our admittedly very complicated last master plan, which I think actually is too much detail. I'll -- maybe I'll ask [Vaibhav] (ph) to analyze it.
Unidentified Company Representative : Sure Elon.
Elon Musk : Can give us the TLDR on the last master plan. But we showed in that last plan that it is possible to take all of us to a fully sustainable energy situation, using sustainable energy power generation and batteries and electric transport. And there are no fundamental material limitations. Like, there's not some very rare material that we don't have enough of on earth. We actually have enough of raw materials to, yeah, take all of human civilization make it fully sustainable. And even if civilization dramatically increased its electricity usage, it would still be fully sustainable. One way to think of the progress of a civilization, it's based out a little esoteric, but is percentage completion of Kardashev scale. So Kardashev Scale 1 would be you're using all the power of a planet. We were we're currently less than 1% on Kardashev Level 1. Level 2 would be using all the power of the sun. And level 3, all the power of the galaxy. So we have a long way to go. Long way to go. When you think in Kardashev terms, it becomes obvious that by far the biggest source of energy is the sun. Everything else is in the noise. So in conclusion, Tesla is focused on building the future of energy, transport, robotics, and AI. And this is a time when others are just focused on managing around near term trends. We think what we're doing is the right approach. And, if we execute on our objectives, then I think we will. Tesla my prediction is Tesla will become the most valuable company in the world and probably by a long by a long shot. I want to thank the Tesla team once again for strong execution in a tough operating environment, and we're looking forward to building, an incredibly exciting future. Thank you.
Travis Axelrod : Great. Thank you very much, Elon. And I'll let Vaibhav pass some more big remarks as well.
Vaibhav Taneja : Yeah. Thanks. Our Q3 results were positive and once again, demonstrate the scale to which businesses evolved. What they use with the generation of record operating cash flows of $6.3 billion. Our automotive revenues grew both quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year. While we had unit volume growth, we did experience reduction in ASPs, primarily due to the impact of financing incentives. As a reminder, we are providing these incentives primarily using third-party banks and financial institution and recognize the cost of these incentives as an upfront reduction to them. We released FSD for Cybertruck and other features like Actually Smart Summon, like Elon talked about in North America, which contributed $326 million of revenues in the quarter. We continue to see elevated levels of regular 2 week credit sales with over $2 billion of revenues so far this year. To expand on this at an industrial level, China continues to outperform U.S. and Europe by a factor of three. And if there is something to be learned from that, this gives a signal of what is to come in other regions. As customers’ acceptance of EV growth. And we feel that is the right strategy to build affordable and more compelling leads. Our focus remains on growing unit volume, while avoiding a build-up of inventory. To support this strategy, we're continuing to offer extremely compelling vehicle financing options in every market. When you compare any vehicle in our lineup with other OEMs, believe our vehicles provide much better value, particularly when you consider the safety features, performance, and unparalleled software functionalities, like David also talked about, include also what, Ashok talked about around autonomy, music options, parental controls, and much more. While every vehicle in our lineup comes up with these capabilities, there is an awareness gap, not just with buyers, but at times, even with existing owners. We plan on making these more visible in our interactions with both existing and future customers. Automotive margins improved quarter over quarter as a result of a 50 features released discussed before. Increase in our overall production and delivery volume, albeit benefit from the marketing pricing, and more localized deliveries in region, which resulted in lower freight and duties. Sustaining these margins in Q4, however, will be challenging given the current economic environment. Note that we are focused on the cost per vehicle, and there are numerous work streams within the company to squeeze that cost without compromising on customer experience.
Elon Musk: Yes. I'm assuming that's a helpful -- hopefully, a helpful macro trend is if there's a decline in in interest rates, this has a massive effect on the, automotive demand. The vast majority of people is or the demand is driven by the monthly payment. Can they put monthly payment? So, like, most likely, we'll see continue to decline interest rates, which helps with affordability vehicles.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yeah. I mean, that is one trend which we observed in the industry that, because of affordability being impacted because of interest rates, People are willing to take cars longer, especially in the U.S. And that is actually having an impact on all our industry too. As we discussed, earlier, as we discussed impact orders, energy deployments fluctuate quarter over quarter due to customer readiness, location of orders being fulfilled, and not necessarily an indicator of demand or production within the quarter. While we did see a decline in Q3, we expect to grow our deployment sequentially in Q4 to end the year with more than doubled of last year. Energy margins in Q3 were a record at more than 30%. This is a function of mix of projects being deployed in the quarter. Note that there will be fluctuation in margins as we manage through deployments and our inventory. Our pipeline and backlog continue to grow quarter over quarter as we fill our 2025 production slots, and we're doing our little best to keep up with the demand. Just coming back on automotive margins, I talked about -- sorry. I talked about what is happening. One other thing which I want to also share is that we're -- that we will continue to keep whatever we can to squeeze like I said before about squeezing out the cost. But this is something which we also are very capable of. I mean, just in Q3, we reached our lowest cost per micro. And that is a trend which we will keep focus on. Then going on to service and other, we continue to show improvements in Q3. This was a result of better performance, both in our service business, which includes collision part sales and merchandise, and continued growth in supercharging. These field based revenues will continue to grow as the overall fleet size increases. Our operating expenses declined quarter over quarter in a year on year basis. This is partially due to the restructuring we undertook in Q2. Cost savings from these initiatives were partially offset by increase in costs related to our AI efforts. We've started using the GPU cluster based out of our factory house and ahead of schedule, and are on track to get 50k GPUs deployed in Texas by the end of this month. One thing which I'd like to elaborate is that we're being very judicious on our AI compute spend too and saying how best we can utilize the existing infrastructure before making further investments. On the CapEx front, we had about $3.5 billion in the quarter. This was a sequential increase largely because of investments in AI compute. We now expect our CapEx for the year to be in excess of $11 billion. We shared our vision for the future at the real world event at the beginning of the month. The Tesla team is hyper focused on delivering on that version, and all efforts are underway to make it a reality. While we've achieved significant progress this year, it will take time to get this as we find a new and incredibly complex technologies and navigate a fragmented regulatory landscape. Future is incredibly bright, and I want to thank the Tesla team once again for all their help.
A - Travis Axelrod : Great. Thank you very much, Vaibhav. Now we'll go to investor questions. The first one is, is Tesla still on track to deliver the more affordable model next year as mentioned by Elon earlier? And how does it align with your AI product roadmap?
Lars Moravy: Sure. I mean, as Elon and Vaibhav both said, you are in plan, to meet that in the first half of next year. Our mission has always been to lower the cost of our vehicles to increase the adoption of sustainable energy and transport. Part of that is lowering the cost for current vehicles, which is where, all of the personally owned vehicles that we sell today come in. But the next stage in that really is it fits into AI roadmap is when we bring in robotaxis, which lowers the initial cost of getting into an EV. And those -- that's really where we see the marriage of EV road map and the AI road map.
Elon Musk: Yeah. It'll be with incentive sub-30k, which is kind of a key threshold.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you very much. Similar, question next. When can we expect Tesla to give us the $25,000 non-robotaxi regular car model?
Elon Musk: We're not breaking it on.
Lars Moravy: Yeah. All our vehicles today are road jets.
Elon Musk: I think we've made very clear that, we're the future is autonomous. It I mean, I it's going to be you know, I've actually said this many years ago, but that, in my strong belief, and I believe that is panning out to be true. So and I'll be very obvious in retrospect, is that the future is autonomous electric vehicles, and, non-autonomous gasoline vehicles in the future will be like riding a horse and using a foot bone. It's not that there are no horses. Yeah. There are some horses, but they're unusual. They're niche. And so it just everything's going to be electric autonomous. I think this is like it should be frankly blindingly obvious at this point that that is the future. So a lot of automotive companies or most automotive companies have not internalized this, which is surprising, because we've been shouting this from the rooftops for such a long time, and it will accrue to their detriment in the future. But all of our vehicles in the future will be autonomous. Yes. So all the vehicles that we've really made, all the 7 million vehicles, vast majority are capable of autonomy. And, we're currently making on the order of 35,000 autonomous vehicles a week. Compare that to, say, Waymo's entire fleet is less than – they’ve have less than a 1,000 cars. We make 35,000 a week.
Lars Moravy: Yeah. And our cars look normal.
Elon Musk: Yeah. They mostly look normal. The Cybertruck looks abnormal. And the, Cybercab/robotaxi. We wanted to have something futuristic working. I think it does look futuristic. And it's worth noting with respect to the Cybercab. It's not it's especially not just a revolutionary vehicle design, but a revolution in vehicle manufacturing that is also coming with the Cybercab. The cycle time, like, the, the units per hour of the Cybercab line it is -- like, this is just really something special. I mean, this is probably a yeah. Half order of magnitude better than other car manufacturing lines. Like not in the same league is what I'm saying. Not in the same league. So it's -- and I said, like, several years ago that the -- maybe the most I mean, the hottest Tesla product to copy will be the factory. Just like buy a factory.
Lars Moravy: Yeah. In camera versus near a factory, that's up to my --
Elon Musk: Yeah. It's like things yeah. So the and as we so we're rapidly evolving and manufacturing technology. So anyway, there's, like, basically, I think having a regular $25,000 model is pointless. Yeah. It would be silly. Like, it'll be completely at odds with what we believe.
Lars Moravy: In autonomous world. But matters as well as cost per mile of efficiency of that vehicle. And that's what we've done with the robotaxi.
Elon Musk: Exactly. Autonomous, it it's fully considered cost per mile, is what matters. And if you try to make a car that is, essentially, a hybrid manual automatic cars. It's not going to be as good as a dedicated autonomous car. So, yeah -- Cybercab is just not going to have steering wheels and pads. It's only designed to optimize for autonomy. But now it'll cost on the order of cost roughly $25,000. So it is a $25,000 car. And you can -- you will be able to buy one on an exclusive exclusively if you want. So just what happens to your mobile phones. You don't need it.
Travis Axelrod : Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, what is Tesla doing to alleviate long wait times at service centers?
Unidentified Company Representative : So we aim on solving problems at the source, so at the factory before they can even affect our customers. We believe the best service is no service and our heads don't even have them.
Elon Musk: If the car doesn't break, yeah. That's the best thing.
Unidentified Company Representative: Exactly. Don't see any with the test. You either do it remote, yeah fix the issue upstream or do it remotely, do it through software, maybe being at work or at home and car can be parked. And we've addressed fixed the issue, and we've partnered the field with service to make sure we're looking at the same issues. And additionally, just in Q3 Q4 of this year alone, we have opened and will open in total at nearly 70 locations. And in North America, we've significantly expand the size of each location and have doubled the size last year compared to this year.
Elon Musk: Yeah. I think it's, like, actually a lot of merit to having large service centers because you can have specialization of labor. Okay. You can start to approach. Yeah. It should be more factory like, where you can have dedicated lanes for particular types of service. And people and it's way easier for somebody to come expert in a few different types of repairs than in every repair.
Unidentified Company Representative : Exactly. This has helped us with the base set, these heavy repairs clogging up the lane. They've dedicated lanes for different type of repairs. And so it's through a bit massively treating it like a factory.
Elon Musk : Yes. This is where a Tesla structure, I think, a strong advantage relative to the rest of the auto industry because we make the cars and we service the cars, whereas I think there's a bit of a conflict of interest with the dealer model and the traditional OEM and dealer model where the dealerships make most of their money on service. And so they don't -- they obviously assistance to reduce the servicing cost, whereas in our case, we are incented to reduce the service and cost because we carry that servicing cost. And we've got a good feedback with our cars.
Unidentified Company Representative : Exactly. If you were with the factory, with the service leaders together, and send back people from the factories that field to the factory to see it firsthand. Suggestions for manufacturing as well as for engineering on design.
Elon Musk : Yeah. So I view this as a structural -- fundamental structural advantage of Tesla versus the rest of the auto industry.
Unidentified Company Representative: Also do a bunch of work on the software side, not only to automate diagnostics so identifying what needs to be done to a car before it comes into service, but also automating all of the preparation work and aligning all the resources that are necessary in order for the car to be very efficiently worked on once it arrives. So the parts are there, like, the lift is scheduled, the technician's schedule, like, everything that's what I'm saying. This is what's wrong with me, and tells us tell the service center.
Unidentified Company Representative : The car everything ready in the van.
Elon Musk : Yeah. Please fix me and this is what's wrong.
Unidentified Company Representative : This is what I'm trying to do now. This is what I'm trying to do. Yeah.
Unidentified Company Representative : Instead of customer trying to translate the car, it's telling us directly and we're pulling that. Yeah.
Elon Musk: Yeah. You don't need most of the time, you don't need to diagnose the car when it arrives. The car yeah -- this is like, again, a fundamental technology advantage and structural advantage compared to the rest of the auto industry.
Vaibhav Taneja : I think it's underappreciated as to what all we are able to do. And that's why because like you said before, most of our cars, except for Cybertruck, look the same. So people don't realize that it has so much capability.
Elon Musk: Yeah. But, like, that's better than other cars. But they don't, like, obviously, like, super futuristic. Yes.
Travis Axelrod: So yeah. Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, please provide an update on the semi. What will the next stage of growth look like, and when will FSD be ready?
Lars Moravy: Sure. So as you we posted in earnings back, we're progressing swiftly on the build of the semi factory in there, in our data factory in Reno. We've released all our major capital expenditures for that program, and we're on track to start, pilot builds in the second half of next year with production starting in the first half of 2026 and ramping really throughout the year to full production. Semi, growth will largely depend on our customers' adoption of the product.
Elon Musk: Well, I don't think we're going to be demand limited, honestly.
Lars Moravy: Yeah. Which I was going to say, which is like a brainer for the semi because it's really a commodity of total cost of ownership.
Elon Musk: Yes. Exactly. It's good. We have kind of ridiculous demand for the semi.
Unidentified Company Representative: In that world where it's about how much do I spend to go to excess lanes per mile, it's a no brainer.
Lars Moravy: Yeah. Fundamentally, if you've got a semi where the fully considered cost per mile or per ton of transport, is better than, say, diesel truck, any company that doesn't adopt an electric semi will lose. It's not -- it's not it's not a subjective thing. It's like whether do you like just a competitive I mean, we like, we want the start we want we want to have a good old semi-truck, but frankly, if we made an oxy semi-truck, it wouldn't matter.
Lars Moravy: And this is proving so in our fleets, in in Pepsi's Partner. In fact, the Pepsi actually said last week, they're having nobody want their drivers don't want to go back.
Elon Musk: Yeah. Yeah. As soon as we give anyone the electric semi, it it's like -- that's like the choice.
Lars Moravy: It's the, what they want to drive.
Elon Musk: Yeah. That's like so the -- like the most, like their top drivers will, they get to drive the Tesla Semi. It's, it's, it's the, it's the thing they want to drive.
Lars Moravy: It's super fun to drive. It's also very easy to drive.
Elon Musk: It's easy to drive and it holds ass. It's like fast.
Lars Moravy: Superfast. Maybe too fast.
Elon Musk: Well, but I mean, like, like, ring like this. Like, you've seen, like, the videos of where, like, I think, like, Tesla Electric Semi, like, can go uphill Just pass. Speed speeding past, like, the diesel truck or even cars. So, like, it's responsive. It it's you floor it and that that truck actually hurt.
Lars Moravy: And that's a benefit not only for the driver and for the goods, but also for safety in terms of other drivers on the road. You don't get stuck behind the semi. You're not, like in a slowdown situation in an on ramp. I mean, how that plays into, you know, FSD, which is the second part of the question. All of the semis have been since the couple hundred we've deployed already, and the ones that we'll be building next year and throughout, the future have all the hardware and the cameras necessary to, deploy FSD, and we're currently training with that small fleet that we have. And as soon as the fleet is trained and the neural nets are up, we'll get FSD onto that platform.
Elon Musk: Yeah. I mean, it'd be a massive improvement in, driver fatigue, because, driver safety, we've got sort of the anti-jack knifing software. You don't have to worry about your brakes overheating if you go down a down a steep hill because the -- we use regenerative, like, that that energy goes back into the pack. It's just like it's like radically better than it is in some way. It's what the drivers love it.
Travis Axelrod: Great, guys. Thank you very much. Our next question is, when will Tesla incorporate X and Grok in all of the Tesla vehicles?
Elon Musk: Well, I mean, these are relatively small things. But, yeah, with the -- I think, we'll keep expanding, what is available in the car on the on screen and also improving the browser. So, just generally, you can access anything you want in the car. In fact, for the Tesla we're scheduled for autonomy. You actually want fully a system that is can do anything. Like, if you want to browse the Internet, if you want to ask AI questions, if you want to watch a movie, if you want to play a video game, if you want to do some productivity thing, you can do anything you want in an autonomous vehicle because you don't need to drive. So that's why the Cybercab got a nice big screen and a great sound system. So you can watch it -- watch a great movie with, it's like being in a Personal movie theater?
Unidentified Company Representative: This is why we've been building this functionality, adding gaming to the car, adding movies and other, you know, all sorts of different media applications of the car because the cars, that's what you're going to -- that's the cars will be built today.
Elon Musk: There's some fun games, by the way. People haven't tried it. There's Castle Doombad and Polytopia and a bunch of really fun games in the car.
Unidentified Company Representative : Yes. We're constantly looking at what features to add next and we're paying attention to what's most commonly requested by our customers.
Elon Musk: Yes. Play Castle, Doombad. You want --
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you guys very much. The next question is, Elon mentioned unsupervised FSD in California and Texas next year. Does that mean regulators have agreed to it in the entire state for existing Model 3 and 4 vehicles?
Elon Musk : No. As I said earlier, California lost regulation. But they have a pathway? Yeah. I mean, there's a pathway. Obviously, Waymo operates in California. So there's just a lot of forms but a lot of approvals that are required. I mean, I'd be shocked if we don't get approval next year, but it's just not something we totally control. But I think we will get approval next year, in California and Texas. And for the end of the year, it will branch out be beyond California and Texas.
Lars Moravy : I mean, I think it's important to reiterate this. Like, homogeneity or certifying a vehicle at the federal level in the U.S. is done by meeting FMVSS regulations. All our vehicles today that are produced that are autonomous capable meet all those regulations, cybertruck need those regulations. And so the deployment of the vehicle to the road is not a limitation. What is a limitation is what you said at the state level where they control autonomous vehicle deployment. Some states are relatively easy as you mentioned for Texas. Yeah. And so other ones have in place like California that may take a little longer. Other ones haven't set up anything yet, and so we will work through those state by state.
Elon Musk : I do think we should have a federal, I agree. Like, autonomous vehicles should be approved. They just should be -- it should be possible to.
Lars Moravy: Congress, if you're listening, let's say the federal AV --
Elon Musk : There should -- there should be a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles. I mean, that's how the FMVSS is worked. Federal Motor Vehicle. The FMBSS is federal.
Unidentified Company Representative : Yeah. So, I mean, in 2017 and ‘18, they we know it's when regulators started looking at it. And it's really kind of stalled since then, but we would appreciate and would support helping out with those regulators.
Elon Musk : It really needs to be a national approval is important. There's department of government efficiency. I'll try to help make that happen. And you said for everyone, not just Tesla, obviously. But just, like some things in the U.S. are state by state regulated for example, insurance. And it's incredibly painful to do it state by state for 50 states. And, I think we should have there should be a natural approval process for autonomy.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thanks, guys. The next question is, what is the plan for 2025?
Elon Musk : I mean, who we just talked?
Ashok Elluswamy : Yeah. Just. We I mean, basically, we talked through this. There's a lot going on. Elon already mentioned that we're working on cheaper models to come out. I mean, there are work which the team is doing to get the factories ready today to try and make that happen on --
Elon Musk: And by the way, the amount of work required to make a lower cost car is insanely high. But, like, it is harder to get, like, 20% of the cost out of a car than it is to design the car and build the entire factory in the first place. Yeah. It's, like, excruciating. And it's -- and there's not a lot of movies made about the heroes who got 20% of the cost out of a car. But let me tell you, there should be.
Unidentified Company Representative: He's a little changes. And I it's not like a silver.
Elon Musk: Yeah. It's like there should be you the heroes who got 20% cost out of a car is like, damn, I have a lot of respect to them. It was like movie. It's like, I think you probably could make a compelling movie, but I it just no. No. Like, if you actually saw how hard it if people actually saw how hard it was to do that, you'd be like, wow. That's damn hard.
Unidentified Company Representative: Just yesterday we were talking about party.
Elon Musk: Yeah. I mean, honestly, like, literally yeah. I mean, they've been there's a lot of but I do call it sort of like getting cost out of things. It's kind of like it's -- like game of pennies. So it's like game of thrones but pennies. First approximation, if you've got if you've got 10,000 items, in a car, very rough approximation, and each of them cost $4, then you have a $40,000 car. So if you want to make a $35,000 car, you're going to get $0.50 on average out of the 10,000 items.
Unidentified Company Representative: Every part.
Elon Musk: Yeah. And it's like yeah. And then, obviously, the best is you delete some parts. In fact, we've done we have to delete a lot of parts.
Unidentified Company Representative: I'm very excited about the Cybercab design and the well, how we're rethinking the design of a car for the Cybercab, designing it all for high volume production, and then designing machine that builds the machine, that is that I think is also revolutionary. And it's just there's no other car company that's even trying to do what we're doing. Like, I've even heard of it, actually. In fact, I'm certain there is someone like I'm I think this this the new machine that pulls the machine, like, it's inherent it's like the it's put it's designed to be, like, 5x better than a traditional factory. Like, cycle time –
Unidentified Company Representative: Cycle time and, like, part deletion and shipment. I don't think any other car company has the same level of, like, integration of thought that we have when it comes to, like, when you design a part from a white sheet of paper, who's going to make it? Where is it going to be made? How is it going be shipped? How is it going to be assembled into the vehicle? And, like, at any one point, if something is done in a silo, it becomes a bottleneck of either cost or time or efficiency. But with the robotaxi, the development, like, we've done a good job on the like, combining all that and then, like, blowing up how it's made and saying it should be made this way and rethinking it also. It's the most efficient factory possible. That shows in our -- it will show in our CapEx efficiency when we deploy it. It shows in the number of parts. It shows in the simplicity of the vehicle, but also how it performs in in terms of, like, end user, state.
Vaibhav Taneja: Just to close-up, just on the energy front also in ‘25, we will have started with flashing up mega factory Shanghai. We'll continue to increase our storage deployments with Powerwall 3. We plan to continue expanding our supercharging network, getting more OEMs on our network. 4680 that as Elon talked about. That would keep going. And then, there's we're also we'll have our lithium refinery starting to produce. So there's a lot which is going on.
Elon Musk : Yes, so many things. Like crazy thing is like Tesla is winning basically on almost every single thing we're doing. If we're not running now, we're in a where their entire large companies, that's the only thing they do.
Vaibhav Taneja : Yeah. I mean, it's a company -- there are multiple companies within the company.
Elon Musk: Yeah. Tesla's like many companies in one.
Travis Axelrod : Yeah. Guys, just a few more. What is going on with the Tesla Roadster?
Elon Musk: Some things. Well, I just thought to go back to our long-suffering deposit holders of the Tesla Roadster. The reason it hasn't come out yet is because it is -- Roadster is not just icing on the cake, it's the cherry on the icing on the cake. And so our larger mission is to accelerate the progress towards a sustainable energy future, trying to do things that maximize probably the future is good for humanity and for Earth. And so that necessarily means that like the things like that are deserved. We'd like -- we'd all love to work on the Tesla -- next-gen -- it is super fun. And we are working on it, but it has to come behind the more things that have a more serious impact on the -- of the world. So just thank you to all our long-suffering Tesla Roadster deposit holders. And we are actually finally making progress on that. And we're close to finalizing the design on it. It's really going to be something spectacular, mind and some like [Peter Telaria] we're really good friends. Peter was lamenting how the future doesn't have flying cars. Well, we'll see. More to come.
Travis Axelrod : Yeah. Thanks very much. The next one is quite similar to other questions you've had. So when I combine it with the final question. So briefly, could you just detail how robotaxi will roll out? Will it start with a Tesla deployed fleet and then allow customers to add theirs on the subscription model, and then we'll Hardware 3 capable of this.
Ashok Elluswamy : Regarding the Hardware 3, what we saw with was, it was easier to make a progress with starting with Hardware 4 and on the solution and backporting to Hardware 3 instead of directly working on Hardware 3 given that Hardware 4 was more like fundamental hardware capabilities. I think that trend will continue into the next few quarters as well by the first solution rapidly with Hardware 4 and then backwardate and it just takes longer to those things because it's not fundamentally supported in the hardware and it's emulated. But yeah, initially working on Hardware 4, backwarding it to Hardware 3.
Elon Musk : Yes. So answer is we're not 100% sure, but as Ashok mentioned, because by some measure, Hardware 4 has really several times the capability of Hardware 3. It's easier to get things to work with then it takes a lot of effort to sort of squeeze that box analyst hat Hardware 3. And there is some chance that Hardware 3 is -- does not achieve the safety level that allows for unsupervised FSD. There was some chance of that. And if that turns out to be the case, we will upgrade those who bought hardware 3 FSD for free. And we have designed the system to be upgradable. So it's and it's really it's really what just to switch sort of switch out the computer type thing. Like, the camera the cameras are yeah. They're capable. But, anyway, we don't we don't actually know the answers to that. But if it does turn out, we will take we'll make sure we take care of those who are bored FSD on Hardware 3.
Travis Axelrod: Great. In the last few minutes that we have left, we will try to get in some analyst questions. The first question will be coming from, Pierre Ferragu at New Street. Pierre, please feel free to unmute yourself.
Ferragu Pierre: Thanks a lot, guys, for taking my question. I was wondering about, like, the compute you're, you're ramping up. So you gave, like, interesting statistics on how much you have, and you said you don't feel your compute's constrained. And I was wondering, how you are putting to work this additional compute. Is that a game for you of creating, like, larger and larger models, like next generation of models that are larger the way OpenAI go from GPT-3 to GPT-4, or is that more like you're set on your model and you need to throw more and more compute to accelerate the pace of learning to improve reliability. And then I had a quick follow-up really quick on your rollout in Texas and in California next year. The plan as you see today, is it to roll out, like, a fleet or two, with, cars that will start with, like, a supervisory, like, some soup onboard supervision, someone, sitting at the wheel just in case and removing the supervisors progressively, or are you aiming for going, free fledged without even a human super supervisor when you get started?
Elon Musk: Okay. Well, I guess we're going to I'll answer, yeah, the first part of the question. The nature of real world AI is, different from, say, an LLM in that, you have a massive amount of context. So that, like, the you've got, case of Tesla 7 or 8 cameras, that, 9 up to 9 if you include the internal camera that that that so you got gigabytes of context, and that that is then distilled down into a small number of control outputs. Whereas it's like you don't really it's very rare to have in fact, I'm not sure any LLM out there who can do gigabytes of context. And then you've got to then process that in the car with a very small amount of compute power. So, it's all doable and it's happening, but it is a different problem than what, say, a Gemini or OpenAI is doing. And now part of the way you can make up for the fact that the inference computer is quite small is by spending a lot of effort on training. And just like a human, like, you the more you train on something, the less mental workload it takes when you try to -- when you do it, like when the first time like a driving it absolves your whole mind. But then as you train more and more on driving different than the driving becomes a background task. It doesn't -- it only solves a small amount of your mental capacity because you have a lot of training. So we can make up for the fact that the insurance computers -- it's tiny compared to a 10-kilowatt bank of GPUs because you've got a few hundred watts of inference compute. We can make up that with heavy training. So yeah, that's -- and then there's also vast amounts to the actual petabytes of data coming in tremendous. And then sorting out what training is important of the vast amounts of video training video data coming complete what is actually most important for trading. That's quite difficult. But as I said, we're not currently training compute constraint. -- had you want levering
Ashok Elluswamy : Like you mentioned, the training has both an large models, also the trend quicker. But in the end, we still got to take which models are performing better. So the validation network to picking the models because as mentioned this pretty large. We had to drive a lot of miles going close to. We do have simulation and other ways to get those metrics. Those two help, but in the end, that's a big bottleneck. That's why we're not trying to compete constraint alone. And there's other access of scaling as well, which is a data figuring office as more useful. That is an important as focusing on that.
Unidentified Company Representative : Yeah. So as it relates to the second part of your question, Pierre, about safety drivers and rolling it out. Each state has different requirements in terms of how many miles and how much time you need to have a safety driver and not have a safety driver. We're going to follow all those were not regulations are out there. But safety is a priority. But the goal is obviously at when we're ready and safety is there, we'll address from the --
Elon Musk : Yeah. I mean, I guess like we think that we'll be able to have driverless Teslas during paid rides next year, sometime next year.
Travis Axelrod : All right. Thank you. And our next question comes from Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley. Adam, please feel free to unmute yourself.
Adam Jonas : Okay, thanks, everybody. I just had a question about the relationship between Tesla and xAI. Many investors are still not clear how the work at xAI is truly beneficial to Tesla. Some even take the view that the two companies may even be in competition with each other in terms of talent and tech and even your time, Elon. So what's your message to investors on that relationship between Tesla and xAI? And where do you see it going over time?
Elon Musk: Well, I should say that xAI has been helpful to Tesla AI quite a few times in terms of things like scaling it, bought it, like training, just even like recently in the last week or so, improvements in training, where if you're doing a big training one and it fails, be able to continue training and is to recover from a training on has been pretty helpful. But it but there are different problems. xAI is working on artificial general intelligence or artificial super intelligence. Tesla's trying to make autonomous cars and autonomous robots. They're different problems. So, yeah. I mean --
Ashok Elluswamy: I think we've said this before also. Like, all not all AI is equal. Right? I mean, there's AI is a broad spectrum. And we have our own swim lanes. Here, there are certain things which we can collaborate on if needed, but for the most part, we're solving different issues.
Elon Musk: Yeah. Tesla’s focus on real world data. And like I said, saying it is quite a bit different from an element. Because, like, you have you have massive context in the form of video and some other audio, that's going to be distilled very like, with extremely efficient advanced compute. I do think Tesla's the most efficient, in the world in terms of inference compute. Like, because out of necessity, we have to we have to be very good at in in efficient inference. We can't pretend 10 kilowatts of GPUs in a car. We've got a couple 100 watts. So, it's pretty well designed Tesla AI chip, but it's still a couple 100 ones. But there are different problems. I mean, this is, like, the stuff that I said is, like, we're going to running in burns. I mean, it's it is running in burns. Like, answering persons, answering questions on a 10 kilowatt rack. It's like, yeah. Put that in the car. It's a different file. No. Exactly. So, xAI is because I felt there wasn't there wasn't a truth seeking digital super intelligence company out there. Like, that's what it came down to. Like, they needed to be a truth seeking like, an AI company that is very rigorous about, being truthful. So I'm not saying xAI is perfect, but that is but that is at least the explosive aspiration. Even if something is politically incorrect, it should still be truthful. I think this is very important for AI safety. So anyway, I think AI, xAI will it has been helpful to Tesla and will continue to be helpful to Tesla, but they are very different problems. Great. And, I mean, like, if you it also thinking like, what is like, what other car company has that -- has a world class trip design team? Like 0. What other car company has a world class AI team like Tesla does? 0. Those were all startups. They're created from scratch.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you, Elon. And I think that's unfortunately all the time that we have for today. We appreciate all of your questions, and we look forward to hearing you next quarter. Thank you very much and goodbye.",split transcript is available for premium subscribers only.,TSLA
2025-01-29,"Operator: Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2024 Q&A Webcast. My name is Travis Axelrod, the Head of Investor Relations here at Tesla, and I am joined today by Elon Musk and Vaibhav Taneja and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3.00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?
Elon Musk: Thank you. So, in summary, in Q4, we set a record and delivered vehicles at an annualized rate of nearly 2 million a year. So, congratulations to the Tesla team on excellent work, achieving record production and deliveries. Model Y was the best-selling vehicle of any kind for 2024. That's worth noting. Not just the best electric vehicle, the best vehicle of any kind on earth, number one was Model Y. We're staying focused on maximizing volumes and obviously doubling down for, I don't know what, it really, I was going to say doubling down on autonomy, but really it's like autonomy is like 10x-ing. Frankly, doubling is not even enough. We made many critical investments in 2024 in manufacturing AI and robotics that will bear immense fruit in the future, immense. Like it's, in fact, to such a scale that it is difficult to comprehend. And I've said this before, and I'll stand by it. I see a path, I'm not saying it's an easy path, but I see a path for Tesla being the most valuable company in the world by far, not even close. Like, maybe several times more than, I mean, there is a path where Tesla is worth more than the next top five companies combined. There's a path to that. I mean, I think it's like an incredibly, just like a difficult path, but it is an achievable path. So -- and that is overwhelmingly due to autonomous vehicles and autonomous humanoid robots. So, our focus is actually building towards that. And that's where we're laying the ground. We laid the ground work for that in 2024. We'll continue to lay the ground work for that in 2025. In fact, more than laid the groundwork actually, so it would be building the structure, it’d be we're building the manufacturing lines and like -- like, setting up for what I think will be an epic 2026 and a ridiculous ‘27 and ‘28. Ridiculously good. That is my prediction. As yet, very few people understand the value of Full Self Driving and our ability to monetize the fleet. I've -- some of these things I've said for quite a long time and I know people said, well, Elon is the boy who cried wolf like several times but I'm telling you there's a damn wolf this time and you can drive it. In fact, it can drive you. It's a self-driving wolf. For a lot of people, like their experience of Tesla autonomy is like, if it's even a year old, if it's even two years old, it's like meeting someone when they're like a toddler and thinking that they're going to be a toddler forever. But obviously they're not going to be a toddler forever if they grow up. But if their last experience was like, FSD was a toddler, it's like, well, it's grown up now. Have you seen it? It's like walks and talks. And that's really what we've got. And it's difficult for people to understand this because human intuition is linear as opposed to what we're seeing is exponential progress. So, that's why my number one recommendation for anyone who doubts is simply try it. Have you tried it? When's the last time you tried it? And the only people who are skeptical, the only people who are skeptical are those who have not tried it. So, a car goes -- a passenger car typically has only about 10 hours of utility per week out of 168. A very small percentage. Once that car is autonomous, my rough estimate is that it is in use for at least a third of the hours of the week. So, call it 50, maybe 55 hours of the week. And it can be useful both for cargo delivery and people delivery. So, even let's say people are asleep, but you can deliver packages in the middle of the night or resupply restaurants or whatever the case may be, whatever people need at all hours of the day or night. That same asset, the thing that these things that already exist with no incremental cost change, just a software update, now have five times or more the utility than they currently have. I think this will be the largest asset value increase in human history. Maybe there's something bigger, but I just don't know what it is. And so people who look in the rearview mirror are looking for past precedent, except I don't think there is one. So -- but the reality of autonomy is upon us. And I repeat my advice, try driving the car or let it drive you. So, now it works very well in the US, but of course it will over time work just as well everywhere else. So, we're working hard to grow our annual volumes. Our constraint this year -- our current constraint is battery packs this year, but we're working on addressing that constraint. And I think we will make progress on addressing that constraint. And then things are really going to go ballistic next year, and really ballistic in ‘27 and ‘28. So, yeah. So, a bit more on Full Self Driving. Our Q4 Vehicle Safety Report shows continued year-over-year improvement in safety for vehicles so that the safety numbers, if somebody has supervised Full Self Driving turned on or not, the safety differences are gigantic. So, and people have seen the immense improvement with Version 13 and with incremental versions in Version 13 and then Version 14 is going to be yet another step beyond that that is very significant. We launched the Cortex training cluster at Gigafactory Austin, which was a significant contributor to FSD advancement, and we continue to invest in training infrastructure out of Texas headquarters. So, the training needs for Optimus or Optimus humanoid robot are probably at least ultimately 10x of what's needed for the car, at least to get to the full range of useful roles. You can say, how many different roles are there for a humanoid robot versus a car? Humanoid robot has probably, well, 1000 times more uses and more complex things than in a car. That doesn't mean the training scales by a 1000, but it's probably 10x. Now you can do this progressively. So it doesn't mean like, or Tesla is going to spend like $500 billion in training compute. Because we obviously train Optimus to do enough tasks to match the output of Optimus robots. And obviously, the cost of training is dropping dramatically with time. So, it is one of those things where I think long-term, Optimus will be -- Optimus has the potential to be north of $10 trillion in revenue. Like, it's really bananas. So that you can obviously afford a lot of training compute in that situation. In fact, even $500 billion training compute in that situation would be quite a good deal. Yeah. The future's going to be incredibly different from the past, that's for sure. We live at this unbelievable inflection point in human history. So, yeah. So, the proof is in the pudding. So, we're going to be launching unsupervised Full Self Driving as a paid service in Austin in June. So -- and I've talked with the team. We feel confident in being able to do an initial launch of unsupervised, no one in the car, Full Self Driving in Austin in June. We already have Tesla's operating autonomously unsupervised Full Self Driving at our factory in Fremont and we’ll soon be doing that at our factory in Texas. So, thousands of cars every day are driving with no one in them at our Fremont factory in California. They will soon be doing that in Austin and then elsewhere in the world for the rest of our factories which is pretty cool. And the cars aren't just driving to exactly the same spot because obviously it all, [went and collide] (ph) at the same spot. The cars are actually programmed with what lane they need to park in to be picked up for delivery. So, they drive from the factory end of line to their specific - to their destination parking spot and then could be picked up for delivery to customers and then doing this reliably every day, thousands of times a day. It's pretty cool. Like I said, the Teslas will be in the wild with no one in them, in June in Austin. So, what I'm saying is this is not some far-off mythical situation. It's literally, five, six months away, five months away kind of thing. And while we're stepping into -- putting our toe in the water gently at first, just to make sure everything's cool, our solution is a generalized AI solution. It does not require high precision maps of a locality. So we just want to be cautious. It's not that it doesn't work beyond Austin. In fact, it does. We just want to be, put a toe in the water, make sure everything is okay, then put a few more toes in the water, then put a foot in the water with safety of the general public and those in the car as our top priority. With regard to Optimus, obviously I'm making these revenue predictions that sound absolutely insane. I realize that. But they are, I think, they will prove to be accurate. Yeah. Now, with Optimus, there's a lot of uncertainty on the exact timing, because it's not like a train arriving at the station for Optimus. We are designing the train and the station and in real time while also building the tracks. And so they're like, people shouldn’t say like, why didn't the train arrive exactly at 12:05? We're literally designing the train and the track and the station in real time while you're saying, how can we predict this thing with absolute precision? It's impossible. The normal internal plan calls for roughly 10,000 Optimus robots to be built this year. Will we succeed in building 10,000 exactly by the end of December this year? Probably not, but will we succeed in making several thousand? Yes, I think we will. Will those several thousand Optimus robots be doing useful things by the end of year? Yes, I'm confident they will do useful things. The Optimus in use at the Tesla factories, production design one, will inform how - what we change for production design two, which we expect to launch next year. And our goal is to ramp prompt Optimus production faster than maybe anything's ever been ramped. Meaning, like aspirationally an order of magnitude ramp per year. Now, if we aspire to an order of magnitude ramp per year, perhaps we only end up with a half order of magnitude per year. But that's the kind of growth that we're talking about. It doesn't take very many years before we're making 100 million of these things a year. If you go up by, let's say, a factor, by 5x per year, insane. Not 50%, 500%. So, these are big growth numbers. Yeah. But we do need to be -- this is an entirely new supply chain, is entirely new technology. There's nothing off the shelf to use. We try desperately with Optimus to use any existing motors, any actuators, sensors, nothing worked for our humanoid robot, at any price. We had to design everything from physics first principles to work for a humanoid robot and with the most sophisticated hand that has ever been made before, by far. And Optimus will be able to like play the piano and be able to thread a needle. I mean this is the level of precision no one has been able to achieve. And so it's really something special. So, yeah, so -- and my prediction long term is that Optimus will be overwhelmingly the value of the company. Regarding energy, back to Earth. Mr. Elon, can you come back here for a minute? Okay, back to Earth. Energy storage is a big deal and will become, it's already super important, will become incredibly important in the future. And it is something that enables far greater energy output to the grid than is currently possible. Because the grid, the grids are -- the vast majority of the grid has no energy storage capability. So, they have to design the power plants to, for very high peaks and assuming that there's no energy storage. Once you have grid energy storage and home-based energy storage, the actual total energy output per year of the grid is dramatically greater than people think. Maybe it's at least double. This will drive the demand of stationary battery packs, and especially the grid scale ones, to insane, basically as much demand as we could possibly make. So, we have our second factory, which is in Shanghai, that's starting operation and we're building a third factory. So we're trying to ramp output of the stationary battery storage as quickly as possible. Now, there is a challenge here where we have to be careful to that we're not robbing from one pocket to take to another pocket because for a given gigawatt hours per year of the cell output, we have to say, does it go into stationary applications or mobile applications? It can't go both into both. So, we have to make that trade-off. Yeah. But overall, the demand for total gigawatt hours of batteries, whether mobile or stationary, that will grow in a very, very big way over time. So, in conclusion, 2025 really is a pivotal year for Tesla. And when we look back on 2025 and the launch of unsupervised Full Self Driving, true real-world AI that actually works, I think they may regard it as the biggest year in Tesla history, maybe even bigger than our first car, the Roadster or the Model S, so the Model 3 or Model Y. In fact, I think it probably will be viewed ‘25 as maybe the most important year in Tesla's history. There is no company in the world that is as good at real-world AI as Tesla. I don't even know who’s in second place. Like, you say like who's in second place for real-world AI. I would need a very big telescope to see them. That's how far behind they are. All right.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you very much, Elon. And, Vaibhav has some opening remarks as well.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yeah, I'll talk about things on Earth. As Elon mentioned, in Q4, we set records in vehicle deliveries and energy storage deployments in an uncertain macro environment. We were able to grow auto and energy storage volumes both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis. For this, I would like to thank the efforts of everyone at Tesla to make this a reality and our customers who helped us achieve this feat. Coming into the fourth quarter, our focus was to reduce inventory levels in the automotive business and we accomplished that by ending the quarter with the lowest finished good inventory in the last two years. This was a result of offering not only attractive financing options but also other discounts and programs which impacted ASPs. While we saw volume growth in almost all regions that we operate in, we hit a new record for deliveries in the Greater China market. This is an encouraging trend since we grew volume in a highly competitive BEV market. On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline primarily due to lower ASPs and due to the recognition of FSD related revenue in Q3 from feature releases. Our journey on cost reduction continues, and we were able to get our overall cost per car down below $35,000, primarily by material costs. This was despite increased depreciation and other costs as we prepare for the transition to the new Model Y for which we recently started taking orders in all markets. All our factories will start producing the new Model Y next month while we feel confident in our team’s abilities to ramp production quickly, know that it is an unprecedented change and we are not aware of anybody else taking the best-selling car on the planet and updating all factories at the same time. This changeover will result in several weeks of lost production in the quarter. As a result, margins will be impacted due to idle capacity and other ramp related costs, as is common in any launch, but will be overcome as production is ramped. We will be introducing several new products throughout 2025. We are still on track to launch a more affordable model in the first half of 2025 and will continue to expand our lineup from there. From a dollar-for-dollar basis, we believe we have the most compelling lineup today compared to the industry, and it will continue to get better from here. As always, all our products come with the best software in the industry, autonomy features and capable of full autonomy in the future. And despite the premium experience, the total cost of ownership is close to mass market, less premium competitors. Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q4, and this -- and resulted in -- but declined sequentially. This was a result of higher -- sorry, growth came from Megapack and Powerwall. Both businesses continue to be supply constrained, and like Elon mentioned, we're trying to ramp up production with Megafactory Shanghai coming online this quarter onwards. While quarterly deployments will likely continue to fluctuate sequentially, we expect at least 50% growth in deployments year-over-year in 2025. Gross profit and margins in the service and other business was up year-over-year but declined sequentially. This was the result of higher service center costs and lower profit from used car business. The businesses within service and other primarily support our new car business, especially through their impact on total cost of ownership. Therefore, while we manage them to be positive on a GAAP basis, we do not expect similar margins as the rest of the business. There's a lot of uncertainty around tariffs. Over the years, we've tried to localize our supply chain in every market, but we are still very reliant on parts from across the world for all our businesses. Therefore, the imposition of tariffs, which is very likely, and any [Indiscernible] will have an impact on our business and profitability. Our operating expenses grew both year-over-year and sequentially. The biggest driver of the increase was R&D as we continue to invest in AI-related initiatives. The remaining increase came from growth in our sales capabilities and marketing efforts from referral program. For 2025, we expect operating expenses to increase to support our growth initiatives. It is important to point out that the net income in Q4 was impacted by a $600 million mark-to-market benefit from Bitcoin due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for digital assets, whereby we will change -- we will take mark-to-market adjustments through other income every reporting period going forward. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, and despite CapEx increase of over $2.4 billion in 2024, we were able to generate free cash flow of $3.6 billion for the year. CapEx efficiency is something we are extremely focused on. While we have invested in AI-related initiatives, we have done so in a very targeted manner to utilize the spend to get immediate benefits. The build-out of Cortex was accelerated because of the role -- actually to accelerate the rollout of FSD Version 13. Accumulative AI-related CapEx, including infrastructure, so far has been approximately $5 billion. And for 2025, we expect our CapEx to be flat on a year-over-year basis. In conclusion, like Elon said, 2025 is going to be a pivotal year for Tesla. There are a lot of investments which we have made and will continue to make in this coming year, which will set the pace for the next phase of growth. And it is something which now I'm getting out of earth, it is going to be out of this world. And we just are putting the right foundation. And that's all I have.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you very much, Vaibhav. Now, we will move over to investor questions and we'll start with say.com. The first question is, is unsupervised FSD still planned to be released in Texas and California this year? What hurdles still exist to make that happen? You addressed the Texas piece, I think, already, so...
Elon Musk: Yeah, I'm confident that we'll release unsupervised FSD in California this year as well. Yeah, in fact, I think we will most likely release unsupervised FSD in many regions of the country of the US by the end of this year. Like I said, we're just putting our toe in the water, then a few toes, then a foot, then leg, then make sure everything is cool. And we're looking for a safety level that is significantly above the average human driver. So, it's not anywhere like much safer, not like a little bit safer than human, way safer than human. So the standard has to be very high because the moment there's any kind of accident with an autonomous car, this immediately gets worldwide headlines, even though about 40,000 people die every year in car accidents in the US, and most of them don't even get a mention anywhere. But if somebody scrapes a shin with an autonomous car, it's headline news.
Vaibhav Taneja: We want to avoid that.
Elon Musk: Yeah. So it's really from an -- the only thing holding us back is an excess of caution. But people can certainly get a feel for how well the car would perform as unsupervised FSD by simply having a car, allowing the car to drive you around your city and see how many times did you have to intervene. Not where you wanted to intervene or were a little concerned. But how many times did you have to intervene for, for definite safety reasons. And you will find that that is currently very rare, and over time, almost never.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, are there any discussions with other auto companies about licensing FSD?
Elon Musk: Yes. What we're seeing is, at this point, significant interest from a number of major car companies about licensing for Tesla Full Soft Driving technology. What we've generally said is the best way to know what to do is take one of our cars apart, and then you can see where the placement of the cameras are, what the thermal needs are of the Tesla AI inference computer. That's better than us sending some CAD drawings. And then we're only going to entertain situations where the volume would be very high, otherwise it's not worth the complexity. And we will not burden our engineering team with laborious discussions with other engineering teams until we obviously have unsupervised Full Self Driving working throughout the United States. I think the interest level from other manufacturers to license an FSD will be extremely high once it is obvious that unless you have FSD, you're dead.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, is Optimus now mostly design locked for 2025 production?
Elon Musk: Optimus is not design locked. So, when I say like we're designing the train as it's going to -- we're redesigning the train as it’s going down the tracks while redesigning the tracks and the train stations.
Vaibhav Taneja: Every [indiscernible].
Elon Musk: Yeah, it's rapidly evolving. It's rapidly evolving in a good direction. It's pretty damn amazing actually. Team’s doing a fantastic job. We really have, by far, I think by far the best team of humanoid robotics engineers in the world. And we also have all the other ingredients necessary, because you need a great battery pack, you need great power electronics, you need great charging capability, you need great communications, great Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity. And of course, you need real-world AI. And then the ability to scale that production to huge levels. So you have to design for manufacturing. The things that, really what other companies are missing is they're missing the real-world AI and they're missing the ability to scale manufacturing to millions of units a year.
Vaibhav Taneja: I think that is an underappreciated thing that industrialization of design is a whole different thing than making a design.
Elon Musk: Yeah, prototypes are trivial basically. Prototypes are easy, production is hard. I've said that for many years. The problem is that there's like, those who have never been involved in production or manufacturing somehow think that once you come up with some eureka design that you magically can make a million units a year. And this is totally false. There needs to be some Hollywood story where they show actually the problem is manufacturing. I've never even heard of one. It just doesn't fit the narrative. The Hollywood thing is like it's like some lone inventor in a garage goes Eureka and suddenly it files a patent and suddenly there's millions of units. I, like, I'm listening to guys who were missing most really 99% of the story. 1% is another old saying of one person -- like a product is 1% inspiration 99% perspiration. The Hollywood shows you 1% inspiration and minus, but forgets about the 99% perspiration of actually figuring out how to make that initial prototype manufacturable and then manufactured at high volume such that the product is reliable, low cost, consistent, doesn't break down all the time, and that is 100 times harder, at least, than the prototype.
Vaibhav Taneja: Then you have to get it there, deliver it, I think, yeah.
Elon Musk: Yeah, you have to meet all these regulations, and there's a million regulators around the world, it's pretty difficult.
Travis Axelrod: Great, thank you. The next question is also Optimus related. When will Tesla start selling Optimus, and what will the price be?
Elon Musk: Well, the -- it may -- for this year we expect to just close the loop with Optimus being used internally at Tesla, because we obviously can easily use several thousand humanoid robots at Tesla for the most boring, annoying tasks in the factory, like the tasks nobody wants to do, where we have to like beg people to do this task. And then they -- then it's like the robot's totally happy to do the boring, dangerous, repetitive task that no humans want to do. And that's also actually some of the easiest use cases for us to have Optimus do things like load the hopper, like, say you're loading the body line if you're transporting pieces of sheet metal to the robot, which is already robot, the robot welding line for the body, and you just have to nonstop take things out of a, from one fixture to another fixture. And it's a very boring job That's the kind of thing what the Optimus could do.
Vaibhav Taneja: The guy who runs around all the wall studs and the pins.
Elon Musk: Yeah, there's a ton of boring jobs, tedious jobs, dangerous, slightly dangerous jobs that are perfect for Optimus. So we expect to use Optimus for those tasks at our factories and that'll help us close loop for improvement this year. It really was the production Version 2 which I think launches sometime next year. I'd like it to be the beginning of next year but maybe it's more like the middle of next year. And then we have to -- with a production line that is designed for -- on the order of 10,000 units a month versus 1,000 units a month. So, when you're designing a production line for 1,000 units a month, it takes you a while to actually reach anywhere close to 1,000 units a month. For any given production output, it takes a while to actually reach its potential. The current line that we're designing is for roughly 1,000 units a month of Optimus robots. The next line would be for 10,000 units a month. The line after that would be for 100,000 units a month. And I think probably with Version 2, it is a very rough guess because there's so much uncertainty here, very rough guess that we start delivering Optimus robots to companies that are outside of Tesla in maybe the second half of next year, something like that. But like I said, this is such an exponential ramp that it will go from no one's receiving humanoid robots to these things like coming out like crazy.
Vaibhav Taneja: We can't build enough.
Elon Musk: We're always going to be in a we can't build enough situation. Demand will not be a problem even at a high price. And then as I said, like, once we start -- once we're at a steady state of above 1 million units a year, I think the production -- I'm confident at 1 million units a year, that the production cost of Optimus will be less than $20,000. If you compare the complexity of Optimus to the complexity of a car, so just the total mass and complexity of Optimus is much less than a car. So, I would expect that at similar volumes to say the Model Y, which is over 1 million units a year, that you'd see Optimus be, I don't know, half the cost or something like that. What the price of Optimus is a different matter. The price of Optimus will be set by the market demand.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, what is the status on mass production of the Tesla Semi? And how will it impact revenue and scale?
Lars Moravy: I can take that one. So, we just closed out the Semi factory roof of walls last week in Reno, a schedule, which is great with the weather. In Reno, you never know what's going to happen. But we're prepping for mechanical installation of all the equipment in the coming months. The first builds of the high volume Semi design come late this year in 2025 and begin ramping early in 2026. But as we've said before, the Semi is a TCO, no-brainer. I think it's really similar to Optimus, set by how much people pay and it has the total cost of ownership, it's much, much cheaper than any other transportation you can have. So at that point, when we're at scale, it will meaningfully contribute to Tesla's revenue. I think it’s difficult to say how much. Anything you want to add Elon?
Elon Musk: No. I mean, I do think that Tesla Semi, again with autonomy, is going to be incredibly valuable. That we actually have a shortage of truck drivers in America, that's one of the limiting factors on transport. And people are human so they get tired and sometimes there's -- it's -- I have a lot of respect for truck drivers because it's a tough job. But because it's a tough job, there's not that many people that want to do it. And there's actually fewer -- I believe, if my saying is correct, there are a few people entering truck driving as a profession than are not leaving it.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes.
Elon Musk: So when you think, yeah, exactly. So when you consider, okay, there's more people leaving truck driving as a profession than entering it, well, we're going to have a real logistics problem as time goes by. So autonomy will be very important to meet that need. So like, yeah, it will -- I don't know. It's a several billion a year opportunity, which I don't know in this context. Is that -- these days, does several billion a year matter? I think it does. It's not nothing. It's probably -- it might -- it’s probably like a $10 billion a year thing. That's $1 billion a month at some point probably. But it's -- all this is going to pale in comparison to Optimus. So yeah, $1 billion a month is a lot but it's not -- it's going to be like 1% of Optimus.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you very much. We already covered the next question in opening remarks, so moving on. Is it expected that Tesla that will need to upgrade Hardware 3 vehicles? And if so, what is the timeline and expected impact to Tesla's CapEx? I think they are referring to cost there.
Elon Musk: They're really asking the tough questions, aren't they?
Vaibhav Taneja: I guess we reached -- we haven't started working on Hardware 3 yet. We are still making software releases. We released the 12.6 release recently, which was like a -- is like a baby V13, but it's a significant improvement compared to what they had previously. And people are still finding ways, there are still larger motors in the smaller models. So we don't give up on Hardware 3, we're still working on it. Just the releases will trail the Hardware 4 releases.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thanks.
Elon Musk: Yeah. I mean, I think the honest answer is that we're going to have to upgrade people's Hardware 3 computer for those that have bought Full Self Driving, and that is the honest answer and that's going to be painful and difficult but we'll get it done. Now, I'm kind of glad that not that many people bought the FSD package.
Travis Axelrod: Thanks, Elon. The next question. Has Tesla given up on ramping their solar roof product?
Elon Musk: No, we -- sorry, Mike, go ahead, yeah.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, I can take it. Yeah, solar roof is a core part of the residential product portfolio and it still remains. It draws a lot of customer interest despite it being premium products. We've worked on multiple iterations of engineering to make the product easier to install and distribute by reducing SKU count. And more recently, rather than direct installation, we are focused on growth through our nationwide network of certified installers. And many of those, they've been installing solar roof for many years.
Elon Musk: That's actually turned out to be a much better way for the -- like it's just let the roof -- just supply products to the roofing industry. And especially when somebody's is getting a new roof anyway or building a house from scratch, obviously, this is by far the most efficient time to put in a solar roof as opposed to putting a solar roof on a house that -- where the roof still has 20 years of life. That's not economically senseful. But if it's a new house or the roof needs to be replaced anyway, then solar roof can make a lot of sense. And it is a premium product. It's like the Model S, Model X or something, like it's a premium product. I think it looks really cool. And you -- I mean, your house generates electricity. And if you combine it with the Tesla Powerwall battery, then you can be self-sufficient. So, even if the grid turns off, even if the grid turns off for several days, your house still works, and your roof looks awesome. So, it's like, I recommend anyone who had -- who can afford it, get the Tesla solar roof and the Powerwall. Your family’s life might depend on it. And just in terms of convenience, your kids are not going to yell at you because their computers don't work because power went out and you can't charge your phone. Actually happens. Yeah. You literally can't even call anyone because your phones out of juice.
Travis Axelrod: Thank you very much. The next question was covered in opening remarks, so we will skip that. And the last question from say.com. What technical breakthroughs will define V14 of FSD, given that V13 already covered photon to control?
Elon Musk: Well, we're going to help a lot -- help a lot further than [indiscernible] We've been in sort of the nothing but nets situation, nothing but neural nets from photons to controls for a while now for just improving the neural nets. I guess we could get into some of the technical details to some degree. I have to say I continue to be amazed by just how effective order aggressive transformers are at solving a wide range of problems. I mean, Ashok, is there anything you'd like to add there without giving away the sort of family secrets?
Ashok Elluswamy: I mean, except for things we put on X already. Yeah, it's continuing to scale the model size a lot. We scale a bunch in V13, but then there's still room to grow. So we're going to continue to scale the model size. We're going to increase the context length even more. The memory is sort of limited right now. We want to increase the amount of memory, also give to even minutes of context for driving. We're going to add audio and emergency vehicles better, add data of the tricky common cases that we get from the entire fleet, any interventions or any kind of user intervention. We just add that to the data, the dataset. So the scaling in basically every axis, training compute, data set size, model size, model context, and also all the reinforcement learning objectives.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Alrighty. With that, we will move over to analyst questions. So just as a reminder, you will need to unmute yourself to ask your question and the first question will be coming from Daniel Roeska from Bernstein. Daniel, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
Daniel Roeska: Hey, good evening, everybody. It's Daniel from Bernstein. Elon, Tesla's share price clearly already includes quite few of the anticipated benefits you talked about today, yet realizing what you call kind of difficult but achievable will take some time. What are you pushing the Tesla executive team to do differently now to accelerate the innovation in order to realize the value you described for the company.
Elon Musk: Well, I mean, we're, I think, working on perfecting real-world AI and making rapid progress week over week, if not month, certainly month over month, but often week over week. I spent a lot of time with the Tesla AI team and the Tesla Optimus team. I mean, I go where the problem is essentially. Like, not -- if something's, this is, unfortunately sometimes, like, don't talk to Tesla executives, and like, hey, we don't see you very often. I'm like, that's because your stuff is working awesome. If you start working really great, unfortunately, I didn't see them very often because I go where the problem is. So, [indiscernible] what's the greatest challenge that lies ahead? So obviously there are many challenges with Optimus. It's a hard problem to solve. Many challenges with vehicle autonomy. But we're making rapid progress in both. Yeah.
Daniel Roeska: Okay. I mean, it sounds like you've got a conviction that the pieces you need, right, are in place. If we kind of go 12 months down the line and we look back, and you had some of those, but maybe what are the kind of two or three KPIs that would tell you that you're on track and it's going the right way and the pieces you've put in place are the right pieces, right? That's kind of what I'm looking for or other way around, where would it be off most likely in your mind that you say, hey, I need to go back there and I need to change something to enable the team better?
Elon Musk: Well, I mean, I think my predictions that I'm making here are going to be pretty accurate. And it's worth the next -- sometimes people say, Elon's always late. Well, actually, no, the problem is that the media reports on when I'm late, but never reports when I'm early. So sure, I'm optimistic, but I'm not that optimistic. There are many cases in the past where I actually, we've been early, such as completion of the Shanghai factory or factory completion has generally have been ahead of schedule, not behind. So, yeah, so the -- but I like to say I'm very confident we'll have released unsupervised Full Self Driving fully autonomous Teslas in Austin and several other cities in America by the end of this year. That's probably everywhere in America next year, and everywhere in North America at least. I think in terms of next year our constraints, I think it's likely to be just regulatory. Like Europe really has, for example, Europe is a layer cake of regulations and bureaucracy, which really needs to be addressed. There's this joke like America innovates, Europe regulates. It's like, guys, there's too many refs on the field. I mean, for example, for us to just to release supervised Full Self Driving in Europe, even though it works really well, we have to go through a mountain of paperwork with the Netherlands, which is our primary regulatory authority. Then the Netherlands presents this to the EU and I think May. And there's like this big EU country committee. We expect it to be approved at that time, but there's nothing we can do to make that may happen sooner. In fact, nobody seems to do it. But I guess all the countries would have to somehow vote in some way to have it happen sooner than May. Otherwise, it won't happen sooner than May. So then when is unsupervised FSD allowed in Europe? I’m like, May next year maybe? I don't know. I have to find out when the EU is meeting again. Sometimes it's a 12-month cadence, sometimes a six-month cadence. Then in China, which is a gigantic market, we do have some challenges because they weren't, currently allow us to transfer training video outside of China. And then the US government wouldn't let us do training in China. So we're in a bit of a bind there. So like, bit of a quandary. So we are already solving then is by literally looking at videos of streets in China that are available on the Internet to understand and then feeding that into our video training so that publicly available video of street signs and traffic rules in China can be used for training and then also putting it in a very accurate simulator. And so it will train using SIM for bus lanes in China. Like bus lanes in China, by the way, were about the biggest challenges in making FSD work in China is the bus lanes are very complicated. And there's like literally like hours of the day that you're allowed to be there and not be there. And then if you accidentally go in that bus lane at the wrong time, you get an automatic ticket instantly. So, it's kind of a big deal, bus lanes in China. So we're going to put that into our simulator, train on that. The car has to know what time of day it is, read the sign. Anyway, we'll get this solved. But I think we'll have unsupervised FSD in almost every market this year limited simply by regulatory issues, not technical capability. And then unsupervised FSD in the US this year, in many cities, but nationwide next year. And hopefully we have unsupervised FSD in most countries by the end of next year. That's my prediction with the best data that I have right now.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you very much. The next question will come from Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley. Adam, please feel free to unmute yourself.
Adam Jonas: Thanks everybody. So, Elon, you've said in the past about LiDAR, for AVs at least, that LiDAR is a crutch, a fool's errand. I think you even told me once, even if it was free, you'd say you wouldn't use it. Do you still feel that way?
Elon Musk: Yes.
Adam Jonas: Care to elaborate or just, I have another question.
Elon Musk: Look, we even have a radar in the car and we turned it off.
Adam Jonas: I got it. All right. So you're still -- people think you're crazy for not looking to LiDAR.
Elon Musk: Obviously humans drive without shooting lasers out of their eyes. Unless you're Superman. But like humans drive just with passive visual, humans drive with eyes and a neural net and a brain neural net. So the digital equivalent of eyes and a brain are cameras and digital neural nets or AI. So that's the entire road system was designed for passive optical neural nets. That's how the whole road system was not designed and what everyone's expecting, that's how we expect other cars to behave. So therefore that is very obviously the solution for Full Self Driving in it as a generalized, but the generalized solution for Full Self Driving as opposed to the very specific, neighborhood by neighborhood solution, which is very difficult to maintain, which is what our competitors are doing.
Adam Jonas: I got it.
Elon Musk: Yeah. I mean, LiDAR doesn't work in the fall, guys. LiDAR has a lot of issues. I don't have to like, the SpaceX Dragon docks with the space station using LiDAR that a program that I've personally spearheaded. I don't have some fundamental bizarre dislike of LiDAR. It's simply the wrong solution for driving cars on roads.
Adam Jonas: Right. You understand how light are works. I get it.
Elon Musk: Literally designed and built our own red LiDAR. I oversaw the project, the engineering thing. It was my decision to use LiDAR on Dragon and I oversaw the engineering project directly. So I'm like we literally designed and made a radar, a LiDAR to dock with the space station. But if I thought it was the right solution for cars, I would do that, but it isn't.
Adam Jonas: Yeah. All right. Just as a follow up. At CES, you said, I'm paraphrasing, that any AI will be able to do any cognitive task not involving atoms within the next three or four years. And that would imply, Elon, that before the end of President Trump's term in office, that AI would be moving pretty damn quickly into the physical world, into the world of photons and atoms. And I'm thinking, given your work with the administration, how confident are you that the US will have the manufacturing and the supply base to make good on your excitement about physical AI by the end of -- by latter this decade. We seem pretty vulnerable right now. I've seen you tweeting about, or sorry, X-ing, excuse me, Elon, about China, Freudian slip, about China having like making more drones in a day than the US makes in a year and all the entanglement of the supply. So, what has to happen in the US to make that possible? What's your message and what can what can you do about it and what's relevant for Tesla shareholders? Thanks, Elon.
Elon Musk: Well, at Tesla, obviously, we think manufacturing is cool. SpaceX, we think manufacturing is cool. But in general, for talented Americans, they need to be beyond, beyond my companies, beyond me and my teams here, in general, we need to make manufacturing cool again in America. And, like, I honestly think people should move from like law and finance into manufacturing. That's my honest opinion. We have too much, this is both a compliment and a criticism. We have too much talent in law and finance in America. And there should be more of that talent in manufacturing. So, yeah. The potential for the future. I mean, it tells that we're making sure that we can continue to manufacture our stuff. Even in the event of geopolitical tensions rising to very high levels.
Adam Jonas: Great. Thank you very much. The next question will come from Pierre Ferragu at New Street. Pierre, please feel free to unmute yourself.
Pierre Ferragu: Hey, thanks guys for taking the question. So, I have a question on deploying like robotaxis in June in Austin. So that's great news. And I was wondering if it means I can drive down to Austin in June and try unsupervised by myself with my car, or it's going to be more like your fleet testing it?
Elon Musk: It'll be our fleet testing it. That's our sort of toe in the water. We'll be scrutinizing it very carefully, make sure it's not something we missed. But it will be, autonomous ride-hailing for money in Austin in June. And then as shortly as possible other cities in America. And I expect us to be operating, doing unsupervised activity with our internal fleet in several cities by the end of the year. Then it's probably next year when people are able to add or subtract their car from the fleet. So, kind of like Airbnb where you can sort of add or subtract your house or your guest room, you can say like add it to the Airbnb inventory or don't add it to the Airbnb inventory. If you're traveling for a month, or whatever, in case maybe you can, that other people use your house. Anyway, that's probably next year because we want to just make sure we've ironed out any kinks. And a lot of it is, it's not like we're not splitting the atom here. It's just a bunch of work that needs to be done to make sure the whole thing works efficiently, that people can order the car. It comes, it's the right spot, does exactly the right thing. All the payment systems work. The billing works.
Pierre Ferragu: Yeah. Okay. But then, like, so my follow-up question would be, I have a Tesla, I have a FSD, and I have to keep my eyes on the road all the time. It's super boring because I don't really need to intervene anymore. And the really annoying thing is that I can't just check my emails. And so are you working also on introducing, like a kind of like free and supervised where I could be eyes off and I would be able to check my email and we just need to, with a five second notice, have to go back and keep an eye on what's happening or is that something you're working on as well? Because it feels so close with this certain that I wonder if it's something you'd expect for this year. It's a very sensitive question. I asked for myself to be honest.
Elon Musk: Yes, we just need -- we need to be very confident that the probability of injury is low before we allow people to check with their email and text messages. In fact, right now we're in this perverse situation, which you may have encountered yourself where people will actually go to manual driving to check their text messages so the computer doesn't yell at them and then go then put it back on autonomous mode once they have checked the text messages, which is obviously less safe, significantly less safe, significantly less safe than just letting people check their text once in a while without the computer yelling at them. But we just want to be cautious about the advent that we're in this sort of, neither here nor there, but just for, I mean, I think it's not for many months longer. But yeah, we're in this perverse situation where people will turn the car off autopilot so the computer doesn't yell at them, check the text messages while steering the car with their knee and not looking out the window.
Ashok Elluswamy: And like Elon said, if you have any problems with the system and when people are not looking, that is a dangerous thing. And that's what we're trying to avoid. The capability is getting there, but it's not fully there. That's why he was using the term of tipping a toe in the water, then getting comfortable, then keeping going.
Elon Musk: Yeah. Anyway, it's not far off. But we would not want to prove to ourselves and also prove to regulators that the car is unequivocally safer in autonomous mode than not. And that's, we're not far off. So, this is like low single-digit months.
Ashok Elluswamy: To the safety aspect, we did publish our Vehicle Safety Report today. And then Q4 is one crash for every 5.9 million miles driven compared to a crash every 700,000 miles without…
Elon Musk: We're getting to the point where it's an order of magnitude.
Ashok Elluswamy: Yeah, it's like 8.5 times safer. So it's just about there. It's amazing.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Alrighty. And our last question will be coming from Dan Levy at Barclays. Dan, feel free to unmute yourself.
Dan Levy: Great. Good evening. Thank you for taking other questions. Elon, you've talked about the need for proliferation of sustainable transport in the past as part of sort of broader push to sustainable energy. Look, I know we've heard a lot about President Trump's plans to reverse the EV Mandate and I think there's a view that given regulation is a driver of EV uptake, this could slow EV uptake in the US. So, what would be your view on the right policy in the US, given your comments in the past of the need to push for sustainable transport?
Elon Musk: At this point, I think that sustainable transport is inevitable. I'm highly confident that all transport will be autonomous electric, including aircraft, and that it simply, it can't be stopped any more than one could have stopped the advent of the external combustion engine, steam engine, or one could have stopped the advent of the internal combustion engine. Like, even if you've been the biggest [indiscerinble] advocate on earth, like courses of the way, not these newfangled car automobiles, you can't stop the advent of automobile. It's going to happen. And you can't stop the advent of electric cars. It's going to happen. The only thing holding back electric cars was range, and that is the sole problem.
Dan Levy: Great. And then as a follow up, in the past, Elon, you had made a comment that, you'd be willing to sell cars at effectively no margin to get the cars out there. And there's a comment in the release today of the rate of acceleration of autonomy efforts does impact volume growth. So perhaps you could just talk about, with your efforts on FSD, how we should think about your desire to put more vehicles out in the market to take advantage of your tech advances.
Elon Musk: So, I'm not sure I understand the question. We have a lot of cars. I mean, we've got millions of cars out there.
Vaibhav Taneja: So, is your question, Dan, that how do we marry our future growth aspects with FSD?
Travis Axelrod: Go ahead and unmute yourself, Dan.
Dan Levy: Yeah. More so just how much more aggressively you would be willing to sell your cars versus in light of your improvements on FSD.
Elon Musk: Well, right now, the constraint we're trying to solve is battery production as opposed to demand. So, there are -- now Q1, we've got this massive factory retooling for the new Model Y, for example. That obviously has a short-term impact on output. But the problem we are seeing with, in fact, we're talking that the executive team and I were talking about just before this call was we've got to figure out how to increase total gigawatt hours of battery production this year one way or another. That's the constraint on our output.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Alrighty. And with that, I think we are all done for today. So, thanks, everyone, so much for all your questions. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much, and goodbye.",split transcript is available for premium subscribers only.,TSLA

Andrew Dudum: Thanks, Bill. Our first quarter results marked an outstanding beginning to the year. The momentum we built in 2023 is continuing. As we further advance our mission to help the world feel great for the power of better health. The underlying strength of our business is propelled by an unwavering dedication to delivering the highest quality personalized care possible across each of our 5 core specialties, men's and women's dermatology, mental health, sexual health and weight loss. Strong execution of our strategy is drawing more consumers to our platform than ever before, translating into robust financial performance.
 In the first quarter, subscribers grew by a record 172,000 quarter-over-quarter to over 1.7 million. Personalization continues to resonate with users. The number of subscribers opting for personalized subscription has nearly tripled over the course of the last year to north of 600,000 subscribers, representing just over 35% of subscribers on the platform. Our ability to efficiently acquire and retain users resulted in revenue increasing 46% year-over-year to $278 million, while also generating $32 million of adjusted EBITDA. We believe that our expanding portfolio of personalized solutions, combined with the ability of our brand to reach and resonate with consumers at multiple stages of their health and wellness journeys are driving forces behind our continued success.  
 I'd like to start by providing additional insight into how we see each of these evolving across the year. Starting with our portfolio of personalized solutions. We leverage hundreds of thousands of interactions on our platform to facilitate an understanding of key consumer concerns and challenges that may prevent individuals for reaching optimal outcomes. Partnerships with leading medical institutions and experts within each of our specialties then enable us to provide access to tailored clinical solutions that are crafted with a focus on safety, efficacy and top concerns identified by our customers. This allows providers on our platform to meet their patients' clinical needs at an individual level, targeting things like side effects and adherence through personalized dosages, a variety of product form factors to drive adherence and the ability to address multiple health conditions with one solution.  
 Our infrastructure and scale provide us the ability to equip providers with the breadth of personalized treatment options at mass market prices. Continued expansion and refinement of our personalized portfolio will be a critical component behind our success in 2024 and beyond. In areas like weight loss and dermatology we'll aim to improve the customer experience with more user-friendly form factors and eventually a broader selection of multi-action offerings.  
 Just as with Hard Mints and Hard Health, our upcoming offerings will be focused on various customer needs and use cases across demographics through tailored treatments. Our recent launch of  Sex Rx + plus Climax Control is a great example of this type of innovation. A 2-in-1 offering designed to help man address multiple aspects of their sexual health without the need to take multiple pills. In the coming years, we expect the vast majority of our subscribers will be utilizing one or more of our personalized offerings.  
 Our brand has historically played a critical role in our success. And early on in our company's life cycle, we built trust and awareness with our customers by making conditions more approachable in driving awareness of these solutions. Traditionally, these efforts were targeted at consumers that were already being impacted by a condition within one of our specialties. Our aspiration is to make Hims & Hers synonymous with high-quality personalized, affordable solutions. And as part of that ambition, we've started to focus efforts on reaching consumers earlier in their journey with a narrative that resonates. In recent years, we have significantly increased our investments in channels that enable us to reach a broader set of consumers at different phases of their journey with a condition.  
 This includes TV and other brand campaigns aimed at consumers during the most culturally relevant moments across society. These efforts are not aimed at immediate user acquisition. Rather, they are centered on raising awareness of our brand and platform capabilities early in an individual's journey with the condition, sometimes even before those journeys formally begin. A multi-specialty platform enables us to do this in an efficient manner as we're able to speak to consumers broadly about a platform of capabilities versus an individual condition. It is clear to us that these efforts are starting to compound. We are seeing users actively seek us out, either by visiting our website directly or through other cost-effective channels.  
 We believe this is happening as users associate the Hims & Hers brand with the treatment of a breadth of conditions and are seeking treatment on our platform, either the result of recalling prior messaging that they saw or increasingly to word of mouth from friends and associates. The growth and efficiency gains we saw in the first quarter are a direct result of these improving dynamics. And solidify our conviction in our ability to achieve our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target of 20% to 30%, while simultaneously maintaining an attractive growth profile. This is an incredibly exciting time for our business.  
 In a very short period, I believe we have established Hims & Hers as the clear leader for accessing high-quality personalized care and the efficiency gains we are seeing throughout our model ensure we can continue to build upon that position for years to come. There are 3 underlying components of this model that allow us to bring this differentiated value proposition to market.  
 First, our technology platform, which serves as the backbone of our innovation process and allows us to seamlessly integrate structured data and direct feedback from both consumers and providers offering invaluable insights into our user preferences and needs. This provides us with critical insights into customer behaviors, why users adopt certain solutions? Why they may switch to another? And why they adhere to particular products? Importantly, we also recognize the sensitivity of this data, and we take significant steps to prioritize customer trust and safety through our commitment to data privacy and security, compliance with applicable privacy laws, and transparency about how we use data.  
 Second, our team of internal medical experts oversee this entire process. With expertise across each of our core specialties, these individuals help ensure that each offering aligns with the highest standards of clinical excellence. And finally, our affiliated pharmacies help ensure that every step of production from formulation to packaging upholds the integrity of our brand and meets the exacting standards of our customers. This enables us to offer access to a wide array of personalized solutions.  Solutions that historically were only available to the wealthiest segments of society at truly accessible prices.  
 Investments across these key pillars are fundamental to our ability to meet growing demand we're experiencing. And fuel future growth. In the near term, this means additional investments in our affiliated pharmacies. Enhancements in both breadth and capacity will position us to further accelerate market penetration while ensuring a best-in-class experience for our customers. Through the integration of robotics and specialized software, we aim to build the necessary infrastructure to bring our unique offering to tens of millions of individuals. These investments will allow us to continue deploying a strategy that focuses on offering a diverse range of solutions that our providers can use to effectively meet individual needs.  
 As we expand these capabilities, we are thrilled to announce that several new and exciting solutions will be launching on our platform in the coming weeks. I look forward to sharing more details as these solutions become available later this quarter.  
 Before I close, I want to thank our teams for their outstanding levels of execution to start the year. We have created a platform that delivers a seamless and comprehensive customer experience by providing an expanding portfolio of personalized solutions at compelling prices. I take extreme pride in how we serve our customers, and I look forward to extending this experience to an ever-growing audience in 2024. Before passing to Yemi, I'd like to reiterate a clarification I shared yesterday. The last few days have been a disheartening reflection of just how divisive a time we live in, and my words have been misconstrued by some. I, in no way, condone nor support acts or threats of violence, antisemitism or intimidation and there's absolutely no justification for violence on our campuses. Every student deserves to feel safe without fear of harm or being targeted for who they are.  
 I am deeply saddened that my support for peaceful protest has been interpreted by some as encouraging violence, intimidation or bigotry of any kind. I do believe deeply in the right for people to use their voices in peaceful protest to drive change.  
 This right is critical to our democracy and must be protected. Our world today is more just because students throughout history have courageously taken to their campuses and used their voices to force change. Generations of Americans have engaged in nonviolent protests and these movements have led to some of the most important changes in our country's history. As a father whose children are both the descendants of Palestinian refugees who fled the Nakba in 1948 and the descendants of Holocaust survivors from Poland. As I've previously shared, I have a personal appreciation for the different perspectives people have, which I live with daily at my dinner table. I hope and pray for peace and for an end to violence everywhere. With that, I will pass it over to Yemi to walk through our financials in greater detail. 
Yemi Okupe: Thanks, Andrew. I will start by providing an overview of our first quarter financial performance and then discuss our updated outlook for 2024. 2024 is off to an exceptional start. Our position as a leader for success in high-quality personalized care has never been more evident, and we are seeing cascading improvements throughout our business as more and more individuals find success on the Hims & Hers platform. We believe we are just scratching the surface of what our platform can do and the number of individuals we can help. Continued robust momentum in the first quarter serves as confirmation of that. Revenue grew 46% year-over-year to $278.2 million. This growth was driven by the ongoing expansion of our subscriber base.  
 Subscribers grew 41% year-over-year to 1.7 million. The first quarter represented a record level of quarter-over-quarter subscriber additions on our platform as we added 172,000 net new subscribers. Our strategy of equipping providers with high-quality personalized solutions at mass market prices is a significant driving force behind our success. In just 2 years, the number of subscribers that have opted for a personalized subscription has increased over 6x to north of 600,000 subscribers.  
 With this continued transition, we believe several benefits will emerge in the future. The first is improved retention. We are receiving signals across several specialties the retention for personalized products is higher alongside a stronger user preference for them relative to generic alternatives. This does not come as a surprise to us, as feedback from user interactions and behavior is one of the key ingredients and development of our offerings.  
 We expect continued placement of personalized treatment options at increasingly mass market prices to compound this benefit. Secondarily, we see opportunities for improved efficiency. Benefits from economies of scale with our personalized offerings are expected, similar to what we have observed in other areas of our operation in the past. We are confident that these benefits will compound as we continue to extend our portfolio of personalize offerings over the course of 2024.  
 Margins remain robust as we continue to leverage strong execution with the economies of scale. Gross margins expanded 2 points year-over-year in the first quarter to over 82%, relatively flat when compared with the prior quarter. Our team continues to leverage affiliated pharmacies in other areas of our network to drive efficiencies across key costs such as logistics, raw ingredients and customer support. We continue to experiment with the highest value ways to pass this value to our consumers, and we are excited to continue to enhance the value they receive in the future.  
 As our platform scales, we continue to see G&A leverage. G&A improved 4 points year-over-year to 12% of revenue in the first quarter. Cost as a percentage of revenue associated with operations and support as well as technology and development were both relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. At the foundation of the Hims & Hers platform is a delightful end-to-end experience for our consumers across multiple specialties. We believe we can continue to drive robust growth with personalized solutions through firstly, drawing a broader audience of consumers impacted by a condition to seek treatment.  
 Secondarily, attracting a greater share of users currently seeking treatment within the specialties Hims & Hers covers and lastly, increasingly longevity of users on the platform, a multi-specialty platform with unique personalized offerings and a compelling end-to-end experience has provided us with increased confidence to invest in reaching users early in their life cycle journey.  
 As Andrew mentioned, our aim over time is to make Hims & Hers synonymous with high-quality personalized solutions. In the first quarter, we saw a meaningful benefit from reaching a broader audience with a compelling experience and suite of offerings. Marketing as a percentage of revenue improved more than 400 basis points on both a sequential and year-over-year basis in the first quarter to 47%. Stronger retention, combined with increased acquisition of users through lower cost channels drove leverage. We are pleased to see this amount of leverage during a time of robust growth and record level additions of net new subscribers because it serves as a proof point of our ability to maintain strong growth while driving leverage.  
 Our expectation is that we will continue to opportunistically utilize marketing as a discretionary lever to continue to reach consumers at various points in their journeys, ensure awareness for unique value propositions and capabilities in the platform as they emerge. And accelerate awareness for newer personalized offerings. As a result, we expect there to be some fluctuation in marketing levels on a quarter-to-quarter basis as we utilize the marketing as a discretionary lever to drive the aforementioned goals. However, we have high conviction in our ability to drive 1 to 3 points of leverage per annum and achieve our North Star adjusted EBITDA margins of 20% or more, no later than 2030. Strong execution and adherence to the principles behind our capital allocation framework are driving record profitability levels.  
 Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $32.3 million as adjusted EBITDA margins expanded over 3 points quarter-over-quarter to close to 12%. Net income was $11.1 million in the first quarter, up almost 10x from last quarter, elevating our conviction that 2024 will be our first year of GAAP profitability. Before providing additional insight into our outlook for the remainder of the year, I'd like to drill into how we allocated capital in the first quarter and our guiding principles for the remainder of the year. Free cash flow generation continues to remain strong. We generated $11.9 million of free cash flow in the first quarter as cash flow from operations exceeded investment in fixed assets within our affiliated pharmacies of $10.6 million. Over the course of the first quarter, we saw what we believe to be a meaningful disconnect in our market value relative to our intrinsic value. We believe this was the result of a natural shareholder rotation, driven primarily by members of our pre-IPO shareholder base as well as general market volatility.  
 We repurchased approximately 2 million shares in the first quarter as a result of these dynamics. At the end of the first quarter, $20 million remain within our $50 million share repurchase program. As a result of these actions, cash and short-term investments decreased by approximately $17 million in the first quarter. As of the end of the first quarter, $204 million of cash and short-term investments remain on our balance sheet.  
 Looking forward, our priority for capital deployment are as follows. Our highest priority remains around positioning our business for growth. We expect meaningful deployment of capital in our affiliated pharmacies over the course of the next 3 years. Consumer feedback has been resoundingly positive, and we expect future investment will enable us to continue expanding the breadth and capacity of personalized offerings across each of our 5 core specialties. Our aspiration is to have tens of millions of subscribers on our platform, and we expect the majority will subscribe to a personalized solution. Additionally, our scale allows us to make positive ROI investments in our facilities that we expect will increase our ability to offer solutions to consumers at mass market prices. These investments can come in the form of automation as well as incremental operations in logistically advantageous locations.  
 Our next priority is capitalizing on moments, and we feel there are meaningful disconnects between our market value and intrinsic value with the repurchase of shares. 
 Lastly, we will continue to take the opportunity to utilize our cash flow generation profile to further strengthen our balance sheet. We believe this will provide additional option value for opportunities in the future. We are grateful and confident that the strength of our balance sheet and cash flow generation profile will enable us to do each of these things in the coming years concurrently. With that backdrop, I'd like to detail our updated outlook for 2024.  
 In the second quarter, we are anticipating revenue in the range of $292 million to $297 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 40% to 43%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $30 million to $35 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11% at the midpoint of both ranges. For the full year, we are anticipating revenue of between $1.2 billion to $1.23 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 38% to 41%. Lastly, we expect 2024 adjusted EBITDA will be between $120 million and $135 million. These adjusted EBITDA and revenue ranges imply an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10% at the midpoint of both ranges. Strong momentum in the first quarter has strengthened our conviction that we will exceed not only our bottom line 2025 targets a year early, but our revenue targets as well. 
 Our ability to concurrently drive record growth while achieving meaningful levels of marketing leverage, reinforce our conviction in reaching our goal of long-term adjusted EBITDA margins north of 20% by 2030. Our ability to drive these incredible results would not be possible without the dedication of hundreds of employees across Hims & Hers. I'd like to thank them as well as our customers and partners that support us in our mission of helping the world feel great through the power of better health. We appreciate the support of our shareholders and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. With that, I will now turn it over to the operator for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Allen Lutz with Bank of America. 
Allen Lutz: Andrew, you mentioned that consumers are seeking out Hims. And the way that you framed it made it seem like this is really the first time that you're seeing such significant efficiency gains. I guess as we think about this in the context of the 2024 guidance, did this come to a surprise to you in the quarter? What do you think is driving this? And then why is it happening now? And I guess as we think about the marketing as a percent of revenue, clearly, there was a nice step down there. Just trying to think through what -- if what we saw in the first quarter is sustainable? 
Andrew Dudum: Thanks, Allen. Great question. Maybe I'll take the first part and let Yemi hit the second. I think what's been happening in the past quarter is a continuation of the last couple of quarters, which is as we've expanded the suite and portfolio of personalized products across the categories, both historical core categories and some of the newer ones like weight loss and women's dermatology and others. That's just bringing a much more diverse set of customers to the company, right? We are getting better at segmentating the types of people that live within each of these categories and offering products that are maybe countering concerns they otherwise had and otherwise were barriers for them adopting treatment. And so I think as we continue to increase the breadth of choices, you're going to see a continuation of people coming to the platform. 
 I think on top of that, which has added extra leverage, we've continued to increase the accessibility of those personalized products, right? We're dropping prices strategically. These are very mass market attractive products and attractive prices that are often compared to the traditional generic treatments price essentially side to side. And so the combination of the personalization and the attractive price point, I think, is something that's just has been growing. From a continuation standpoint, I think, generally, those trends are to be expected, Allen, because we continue to expand the portfolio. But I think there are also dynamics from a marketing leverage standpoint that Yemi can speak to with regard to when we push a little bit heavier and when we pull back. 
Yemi Okupe: Yes. Thanks for the question, Allen. I think the way that we think around it is there will be the peak periods of time where marketing will fluctuate from time to time. We'll use it as a discretionary lever to lean into a variety of different initiatives, whether it's a new category launch or the new -- the launch of new personalized product. Even as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, over the course of like on an annual basis, we do see the ability to continue to gain leverage just as a result of more and more consumers coming to the platform, loving the products, staying on the platform for a longer period of time as well as, as Andrew mentioned, more consumers coming to us organically. And so -- that gives us the confidence that each year over the course of the coming years, we have the ability to get leverage and at the same time we currently maintain growth. 
Allen Lutz: Very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on the personalized solutions, I think, Yemi, you mentioned 35% of subscribers are now taking personalized solutions today. How should we think about the size of the retention improvement from maybe where the company was a couple of years ago versus what personalized solutions are doing currently? Is there any way to frame the improvement quantitatively? 
Yemi Okupe: Yes. I think we can give you some guided principles around what we've been seeing across categories. I think various categories are at different stages in their life cycle. Broadly, what we do see is that personalization -- personalized solutions enable us to do a few things. One is just given that there are not similar products often cases in the market out there to them. We are seeing more and more consumers sign up for not only the personalized products, but also sign up for them at longer durations. And given the fact that many of these products do fundamentally go to the heart of consumer preferences and consumer needs, our belief is that these will be the catalysts that enable consumers to stay on the platform for years or even decades.
 We're starting to see that show up across many specialties in the form of much stronger retention that we've seen with the generic alternatives. And Andrew, not sure if there's anything that you wanted to add there as well. 
Andrew Dudum: Yes, the other thing, Allen, just maybe to give you some color on how this plays out. A lot of customers will cancel overwhelmingly because the treatment itself is not perfectly personalized to them, right? Maybe the form factor is not a form factor that they love using, right? Maybe it's a topical spray and it makes their hair sticky. And so they prefer an oral solution, or maybe vice versa. Or there might be a side effect component, which is common among different treatments that the customer is trying to balance. And so I think the way you can think about it is that we like to dive deep into the data of understanding why customers are canceling and try our best to address them directly with the next level of personalization launches. 
 And so very often, they are directly attacking some of the side effect concerns that we see or some of the form factor concerns we see et cetera. And so I probably can't speak to the magnitude, but definitely something that we've seen pretty consistently and would expect to continue. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Maria Ripps with Canaccord. 
Maria Ripps: Congrats on the strong quarter. First I would just like to ask about your pricing philosophy. It's been about a year since you sort of introduced lower prices. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color on your sort of near-term approach to refining pricing from here? And are there any sort of specialties or maybe products where you've seen particularly higher sort of price elasticity? 
Yemi Okupe: Yes. Thanks for the question, Maria. I think just our fundamental approach is as we continue to see benefits for -- from scale, we're consistently running experiments with respect to how do we pass forward some of that value back to consumers which we feel will increase the longevity on the platform. I think with respect to some of the pricing dynamics, we would lack many of those in the Q2 quarter, and so we expect to see the benefit from that in the second quarter. But that said, I think that's the way that we'll pass value to consumers is not just in the form of price. You can expect additional features or other creative solutions that we're experimenting. 
 And so I think over the course of the year, embedded in our guidance is the flexibility to do that, whether it's with respect to pricing or incremental features that consumers get really with an eye towards addressing their needs and keeping on the platform for longer. 
Andrew Dudum: And I think maybe just to add, Maria, I think philosophically, we aim to build a platform where there are tens of millions of customers across Hims & Hers and believe that the suite of categories and specialties we offer today as well as the ones we'll continue to expand into our categories that affect nearly every household in the country. And so continuing to find leverage in the operational efficiency or automation or throughout the business, and give that back to customers is the core philosophy in order to continue to make those price points accessible in a way that you can truly target that multi tens of millions of customers. 
Maria Ripps: Got it. That's very helpful. And then can you maybe give us a little bit more color on your targeted investments in affiliated pharmacies? You talked about sort of expanding automation capabilities through robotics and software. So any more color sort of on additional capabilities you're able to share? And then are you planning to add sort of more affiliated pharmacy locations at this point? And then lastly, how is this going to -- how are we going to see this sort of flowing through your P&L? Is this largely CapEx or operating expenses? 
Yemi Okupe: Yes. Thanks for the question, Maria. I think that there's a few areas that we would like to invest. And I think that what's becoming overwhelmingly clear is that the strategy of personalization is fundamentally working. And so there are a few areas where we will fundamentally invest. One is just around the breadth of solutions that we offer across each of our specialties. And so over the course of the next year, we'll invest to make sure that we can continue to expand the number of different conditions and concerns for consumers that we address in the form of more SKUs. 
 As part of that, much of the kind of the first half of this year and into the early half of next year, we'll also expect to just ensure that there's deeper capacity to fundamentally meet those needs. The capacity and breadth solutions will be growth dependent. We don't want to get too far ahead of our SKUs as we're investing and so we'll continue to watch those. With respect to where it will show up, you can expect it to primarily be capital expenditures. And then starting from like the -- really, the back half of this year to early next year, our facilities run incredibly efficiently today, but with greater scale, we're uniquely positioned to progressively increase the automation in those facilities. And so we expect to start that process in the back half of the year. That again, which up in the form of CapEx, but we do expect many of those initiatives to be ROI positive and incrementally drive higher margins that we have the ability to, as Andrew mentioned before, philosophically passed through to consumers. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Daniel Grosslight with Citi. 
Daniel Grosslight: I was hoping to get an update on the weight loss program. Really curious on the demographics of the folks that are coming to your platform? Have they tried GLP-1? Or are they a little bit wary of trying GLP-1s and therefore, would rather kind of go with you first. And then as we think about GLP-1s and potentially bringing those to your platform, how it would be great to get an update on your thinking there? And in particular, around the compounded GLP-1s and your ability to do that within your facilities. 
Andrew Dudum: Dan. Great question. So I think overwhelmingly, really excited by what we've seen on weight loss. You're talking about over 100 million people suffering. I think the offering we have is excessively priced, affordable, safe -- and has put it well on target to hit that 100 million in 2025 as we said, I think we will continue to expand that portfolio and expect to launch GLP-1 soon as we've talked about in the past. Regarding compounding, I think probably more to come in the future.
 So probably not too much to share on that today, but it is something we're watching really carefully and wrapping our heads around and the clinical team and the pharmaceutical team are solidifying some perspectives on that, that we should be able to share shortly. 
Daniel Grosslight: Got it. And Andrew, you mentioned that you have one of your -- as one of your goals getting folks on more than one personalized product. I was hoping to get maybe some more details on how many folks right now are on more than one? And maybe any kind of qualitative or quantitative benefit you can provide on those folks? People who have more than one versus just one versus no product -- no personalized products. 
Andrew Dudum: Yes, it's a great question. I think more and more, we're thinking -- more about the concept because I think when you think of more than one, it's really this cross-sell, right? This e-commerce concept. And I think as we watch customer behavior, what's becoming clear is personalized versus non-personalized is really where we're focusing because in a lot of situations, personalized often means cross category. right? 
 So when you think about our heart health category and our sexual health category, that's a single personalized treatment that is treating both sexual dysfunction as well as cardiovascular disease, right? In a single personalized pill. And so I think as a business, we're not really focused on cross-category conversion as much as personalized, human-centric treating an individual holistically. And I think as you start to see some of our categories overlap, for example, on the weight loss category, a lot of overlap with mental health and depressive eating on the mental health category, same thing, overlap with obesity. These categories are not siloed. And so trying to think of a personalized solution that treats all underlying factors of the symptoms or concerns that a patient is having is really the predominant focus. 
 And what we've seen overwhelmingly is if you do that really well, there are multiple reasons that a patient has to continue treatment. And some of those reasons might be more cosmetic and some of those reasons might be more clinical and serious but the combination surely is increasing the stickiness and the retention and the reasons people kind of remind themselves to pull it out of the cabinet or off the shelf and build that habit. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Jack Wallace with Guggenheim Securities. 
Jack Wallace: Congrats on a great start to the year. Andrew, I just wanted to give you an opportunity to -- and thank you for addressing your comments from last week and over the weekend. I just wanted to give you an opportunity to just give us some idea for how the public response reaction to your comments had any observable impact to the business and thinking more specifically around attention -- or excuse me, attrition and retention, new customer acquisition as well as employee attention -- attrition and inbound resumes? 
Andrew Dudum: Thanks, Jack. Yes, great question. So no material impact that we expect in the business. The guidance that we shared today reflects all of the latest thinking. And so we don't expect that to be a big concern at all going forward. 
Jack Wallace: Great. And then I just wanted to get a little more color on the CapEx investments, Yemi. Should we think of the first quarter's CapEx number being a fair kind of jumping off point into the second half of the year? And I appreciate your response to the prior question. And then second, in terms of the therapeutic category, it sounds like maybe weight loss is getting some additional attention with the expanded capabilities there. But any other categories existing that might be getting some extra attention as well as preparation for new categories? 
Yemi Okupe: Yes, I can start with the first part of the question, maybe I'll throw it over to Andrew for the second half. I think what we really see, Jack, is, as mentioned, kind of in the prior question, we'll look to calibrate the capital expenditures relative to the growth that we are seeing. I think historically, if you were relying 2 years ago, capital expenditures were fairly minimal in the low $1 million to $2 million range over the course of the next 3 years, like we do expect just more intensity in the CapEx. We don't expect to return to those levels for the next 3 years, but it will fluctuate as we start to invest in machinery or expanding capabilities in the facilities.
 So it's hard to give an exact like quarter-to-quarter number, but we do expect it to be elevated, similar to what we've seen kind of in the latter part of last year to last quarter. 
Andrew Dudum: Yes, I think a lot of these capabilities are centered around both pharmaceutical complexities. So you can imagine form factor variation. We got a number of form factors on the breadth of specialties and portfolio today, but there's quite a few more that we can be bringing to market. There's complexity in specific ingredient compounding. So there's actually necessary processes for more complex ingredients that are more challenging to put together into these form factors. And then obviously, there are categories that we are excited by that we've talked about in the past. Hormonal balance, menopause, [ stop estrogen ], pain management insomnia. Right? These are categories we've always talked about and believe and believe there's a lot of people struggling and an opportunity to deliver hyperpersonalized treatments at very affordable prices. And so a lot of that CapEx investment is not only going towards some of the near-term categories, but building the foundation for what's going to be necessary a couple of years from now. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Jonna Kim with TD Cowen. 
Jungwon Kim: Just wanted to get a better understanding of sort of what changed in terms of the full year guidance in the first quarter versus how you guided in the fourth quarter. And just curious which areas deliver offside versus your original expectations? And also what changed in terms of your second half expectations? Any color will be helpful there. And just another question is, have you seen any change in consumer behavior by different income cohorts across your categories? 
Yemi Okupe: Maybe I can start with the first part of the question on the guide and then I can turn it over to Andrew for broader clarity around what we're seeing with the consumer. I think really, Jonna, like what we did see in the first quarter is just record level momentum, both in terms of the magnitude of consumers that were coming on to the platform. Relative to what we were expecting as well as the frequency, which was they're opting for personalized products. 
 As we mentioned, those typically do carry higher retention levels. And so really what's embedded in our guidance is just the strong momentum that we've seen. And we're seeing that across pretty much all of our specialties. Given the fact that we've innovated the suite of products, whether it's sexual health, dermatology or the new weight category,  we're seeing continued strength across each of our specialties, and we expect to continue to innovate with a very attractive pipeline on each of those specialties. 
 And so really, that's what's embedded in the guide is, a very strong pipeline of things to come. the strong uptick in consumer acquisition in the first quarter and then just the adoption of personalized products. 
Andrew Dudum: Yes. And then regarding consumer confidence, I think we continue to see strength across the demographics of income levels. I think probably because of a couple of things and this has happened historically when consumer confidence has dropped and others have struggled in traditional consumer channels and our business has remained resilient. I think you're talking about categories and products that are incredibly emotionally resonant and core to the well-being of the consumer, right? They're products that when the customer wakes up in the morning and look in the mirror are highly impactful to how that day goes and how they show up in the world. And so I think very, very sticky in that way. On top of that, I think the strategic pricing initiatives from the last year have continued to make those even further affordable, such that we have not seen any types of concerns in consumer strength whatsoever. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Aaron Kessler with Seaport Global. 
Aaron Kessler: Congrats on the quarter. A couple of questions. One, maybe just if you can update us on the women's kind of performance or the Hers performance. In the quarter, I think you noted a pretty strong growth last quarter. And then just on the mental health side, maybe an update there. I think our recent survey was showing pretty high rates of depression, particularly among younger adults. Just curious kind of what you're seeing there as well. 
Yemi Okupe: Thanks, Aaron, and great to have you. On the Hers side of the business, continuing to see it be one of the fastest growing, if not the fastest growing parts of the business. And this is comprised of Hers dermatology, Hers hair, the Hers weight loss category as well as the mental health business. All of those are growing very robustly and I think really pulling the company ahead in a dramatic way. When we look at some of the penetration rates that the business has in those categories. It's quite small. You're talking 1%, 2% penetration rates in very, very massive markets. And so we suspect that the brand and the investments in the brand that we've been making in the last year or 2 are really just starting to unlock the awareness levels necessary to start taking massive share. 
 But we believe strongly that from what we can tell, we've got strong product market fit in those 3 or 4 categories. the breadth of portfolio of offerings is expanding very rapidly. Many products in the last quarter and many to come in the next couple in a way that gives us confidence that, that growth rate will be able to be sustained for quite some time. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Glen Santangelo with Jefferies. 
Glen Santangelo: Guys, I just wanted to sort of unpack some of the numbers here, maybe a couple of financial questions, if I could. I mean the subscriber growth of 41% in the quarter was almost equivalent with the sort of the revenue growth -- drove. But when I sort of peel back that, the layers a little bit, it looks like the monthly sales per average subscriber were flat, but yet your average order value was up 21%, which may be suggest that you're continuing to have some success booking multi-month subscriptions. I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more a little bit more meat on both those 2 numbers? Because I think what some of us are trying to assess as well as we get the churn question a lot. 
 And so I'm just trying to make sure I understand how all these metrics sort of play off from one another? 
Yemi Okupe: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Glen. I think we stated in the past that the primary growth that we're focused on as a company is around subscriber growth. And so a lot of the strategic initiatives, whether it's around personalization or some of the pricing elements we've talked to historically in the past. Those are geared towards both making it attractive to the consumers to come to the platform as well as keeping consumers on the platform for multiple years, if not even decades. And so largely our performance this quarter was primarily driven off of the subscriber growth, as you mentioned. We expect that to continue to be the case. And with respect to the monthly average revenue per subscriber/AOV, really our focus is, as you mentioned, continuing to make sure that the multi-month bundles are attractive, and we see continued success there. With respect to some of the movement that you see in AOV, it is driven primarily by that as well as some of the product mix dynamics as well with the way we're coming online. 
Glen Santangelo: And Yemi, maybe just one more quick question on the guidance. If I sort of look at the adjusted EBITDA margin you put up in 1Q and what you're sort of implying for 2Q, it seems to suggest a reasonable step down in the back half for the year -- to be consistent with your sort of full year guidance. I was wondering, is that some level of conservatism you're building in? Or are there some -- you've talked on this call about some planned investments that may ultimately be made. So I'm just trying to make some sense of why we should expect the margin in the back half of the year to go down. 
Yemi Okupe: Yes, I think it's a great question. I think Q1 was definitely a phenomenal quarter for us, and we are very excited by the remainder of the year to come. Really what we are doing is we're leaving ourselves flexibility. As we've mentioned, we do continue to look for ways to pass value back to consumers. Whether that's the case of leaning back into marketing as we start to have new categories come online -- sorry, new products come online. We will look to opportunistically have the flexibility to invest there. And then as we mentioned before, over the course of several quarters, we do run experiments, identifying what are the most accretive ways to pass value back to consumers. We're very close to finalizing some of those experiments and excited by those. And so do you want to leave ourselves flexibility in the guide to have the capability to roll out some of those. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Jailendra Singh with Truist Securities. 
Jailendra Singh: Congrats on a strong quarter. First couple of clarification questions on the subscribers using personalized solution 1Q at 35%. What was this figure among the new members you added in 1Q in terms of using a personalized solution. And second part of the question is like what is your outlook reflecting in terms of this figure by end of the year? 
Yemi Okupe: Yes. I think maybe I can start with some of the more granular details. And then can handover to Andrew to add some of the products related questions. We didn't explicitly guide to basically a new number specifically. What we do see is that the adoption for new subscribers of personalized products. Tends to be higher just because I think many of those users for the first time when they come to the platform are identifying the attractiveness of personalized solutions is also what we do see is that in many of the newer categories, the adoption rate is quite strong just because the vast majority of the user base is disproportionately oriented towards new users. And so we do expect that number to basically creep up each quarter alongside it. We're excited by the potential that, that means for retention. And then Andrew [indiscernible]. 
Andrew Dudum: Yes. And Jailendra, maybe just -- I mean, at a high level, I think we expect the vast majority of the business in the coming years to be on being treated with a personalized offering. The underlying relationship these customers have with the platform, the stickiness, the degree of choice and customization that they're provided the flexibility tools that they have are just meaningfully more powerful than a traditional generic treatment. So we expect the vast majority of the business in the coming years to move towards those types of treatments. 
Jailendra Singh: And then my quick follow-up, just trying to better understand your comment around pricing adjustments, flexibility in '24. Has there been any change in your thought process given what you've learned about the consumer behavior competitive environment so far in the year in terms of getting more or less aggressive with those changes in the year? And what kind of data points will you be watching or focused on, which will drive your decision to make these adjustments? 
Yemi Okupe: Yes, if we can go a bit into just like what is the philosophical approach behind some of the changes that we make? And so I think that as a management team, as a company, I think we're less focused on what's happening quarter-to-quarter. As Andrew mentioned, we've seen the consumer remain very resilient just given the types of conditions are oftentimes serving. They tend to be more resilient in nature. And so really, when we think around -- whether it's pricing or other mechanisms that we use to pass value back to consumers, what will drive the decision to do those will be primarily just around the data that we receive in experiments in identifying which categories, which areas and which types of vehicles results in the highest ROI. And so that will be more of the [ governing ] factor versus any given concern or opportunity in a quarter. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler. 
Korinne Wolfmeyer: Congrats on the quarter. To touch on the churn question kind of in a different way. I mean I think what we're all struggling is that it hasn't been quantified very clearly of like what's changed with retention and churn levels. So I guess is there any way you can give us better color on like how many of your multi-month subscribers are ending up doing reorders after their first initial order and how many are falling off? And then any other detail you can give us there? 
Yemi Okupe: Yes. I think what I'd point to, Korinne, and I think it's a great question. I think there are a few data points. One is just like the previous guidance that we've given around long-term retention levels, north of 85%. I think this whole pull-through. And if anything, I think the hope for us would be that, in fact, that gets stronger, we did see across Q1 really is just a record level of additions of net new subscribers, and that's a function of the efficiency on acquisition, but also just some of the benefits and longevity. As we continue to pass value back to consumers in the form of pricing experiments or other value-added ads to consumers. We do expect the retention to improve in the coming quarters, but it's very difficult to give exact quantification numbers around that. 
Korinne Wolfmeyer: Got it. Really appreciate it. And then I think you guys kind of hinted towards some new product launches. And I think, Andrew, you said potentially [ GLP ] to Q1, soon. When you laid out the guidance, how much of the improvement in the guidance is coming from new product launches? And is anything getting pulled forward sooner than anticipated? And then any detail you can give us on timing of GLP-1s? And is that a this year thing or maybe a next year thing? Any color there would be great. 
Andrew Dudum: Yes. On the GLP-1 side, definitely this year, so I would expect them soon as we talked about. Regards to the other side, I'll let Yemi tackle. 
Yemi Okupe: Yes. And with respect to the question around guidance, Korinne, I think that really that's less of a function of a specific categorical launch or product launch and it relates to what it's more of a function of as we expect continued strong demand from consumers that was similar to what we saw in the first quarter. And we do expect a continued uptick in personalized products. We're very excited by the portfolio to come. But historically, with our guidance philosophy, we generally roll forward what we have certainty and visibility into. And so reflected in the guidance is what we can see based upon today and some of the impacts that we have around the products that have already launched or imminently coming. 
Operator: Your next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. 
George Hill: I have kind of 1 big picture one and 1 small picture one, Andrew and Yemi. I guess the small picture one is, do you guys have an opinion kind of at what price point GLP-1s inflect for you from a subscription and volume perspective? And I ask that as somebody from the drug supply chain side, we see pretty significant price competition in that space and discounting in that space. So prices are coming down pretty significantly. And then my follow-up question to that is Yemi to your comments, when you talked about wanting to grow a business that has tens of millions of subscribers, kind of which disease states and product categories do you think are most important for getting to that goal? 
Andrew Dudum: George. On the GLP-1 side, I'm not sure, we probably have a perspective to share on that at this point, but I agree very interesting question and definitely dynamic, right? Changing pretty near time. So I think we'll be able to share more on that shortly. Yemi, I'll let you take the second half. 
Yemi Okupe: Yes. And with respect to the categories, I think George, I think the benefit of our platform is that it's both comprehensive but at the same time, we're very focused on the 5 core specialties that we operate in. Within each of those specialties, there's tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of subscribers for us to go after. And so I think that we are confident in each of the specialties. They have the ability, as we mentioned in the past, to be at least $100 million or more of revenue by next year. Even that said, I think across many of these were just scratching the surface through continued innovation on the personalization side as well as continuing to broaden the product suite at different price points, we do feel very confident in our ability to have each of these multi-hundred million dollar businesses. 
George Hill: Okay. I don't know if there's time for a quick follow-up, but I would ask 1 more about GLP-1s where brand seems to be very important in that category and name brand is very important in that category, where name brand is kind of less important -- your name brand, Hims & Hers is important in your kind of total assets. Is that something that you view as kind of different or like something you can conquer? Or I don't know if you can talk about how you address the marketing aspect of that category and how it's different from what you guys have done historically? 
Andrew Dudum: Yes. I probably can't give too much there, but I do think that when you're talking about GLP-1 and specifically even to Dan's question earlier around compounded GLP-1s, the safety profile and the clinical excellence around those I think it's critical, right? And I think there's a wide range of offerings in market with a wide range probably of clinical best practices -- and I think when we bring things to market, as we've kind of said in the past, we don't necessarily believe we ever need to or should be the first to market, but we should be the best in market. And I think that's the way we'd approach this category and its launch of being able to ensure customers that the offering and the products are the highest quality, the highest testing and have a degree of safety and clinical excellence that is really unmatched and they know that. 
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. This will conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",split transcript is available for premium subscribers only.,HIMS
2024,Q2,2024-08-05,"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Hims & Hers Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Please note that this call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn today’s call over to Bill Newby, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Bill Newby: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Hims & Hers Health second quarter 2024 earnings call. Today after the market closed, we released this quarter's shareholder letter, a copy of which you can find on our website at investors.hims.com.

And with that, I will now turn the call over to Andrew.
Andrew Dudum: Thanks, Bill. The second quarter marked one of the most exciting points in our company's history, as momentum continued to rapidly accelerate in the fulfillment of our mission to help the world feel great to the power of better health. The long-term trend toward the consumerization of health care continues and the belief is that this trend will only accelerate. Consumers are increasingly expecting the same quality and level of service that technology has unlocked across other areas of their lives. This includes speed, convenience, transparency, affordable pricing and a personalized experience. I'm excited by the progress we have made on our platform in unlocking these capabilities for consumers across a broader set of conditions and specialties. We believe that our platform is capable in the long term of delivering a new type of health care, where consumer preference and needs, insights and data to the foundation of a hyper personalized set of offerings, treatments and care. We're more energized than ever to deliver this innovation on behalf of the hundreds of millions of people trying to live their happiest and healthiest lives. Several elements continue to come together in the second quarter to bring us one step closer in making that vision a reality. First, we brought in the number of personalized offerings across our specialties, with four out of five specialties now carrying at least 10 personalized solutions. Second, we expanded our weight management offering with the launch of GLP-1s. Weight is a particularly strategic category for us and that enables us to scale the value that comes from personalized solutions to over 100 million potential consumers. Lastly, we brought on world-class talent across multiple levels of the organization from the Board to ML leaders that will enable us to further refine our capabilities and scale them to increasingly broader audiences. Christopher Payne, who most recently served as President and COO of DoorDash, brings a great depth of experience helping organizations scale their operations globally. Our ambition is to make the world feel great to the power of better health. Foreign policy and regulatory expertise from Anja Manuel will help us broaden the geographic scope of our platform in the coming years. And Kare Schultz brings over three decades of experience in the pharmaceutical industry that can help us effectively navigate the challenges at higher acuity and more complex specialties inclusive of weight may present. Our platform has rapidly scaled from thousands of interactions to millions and with greater personalized capabilities comes the ability to leverage as appropriate, our structured data to further refine and improve our customers' experience on the platform. We recently kicked-off our search for a CTO with expertise in AI and machine learning. We believe this hire will help put us at the forefront of the many exciting opportunities AI can bring in health care. Strong progress across these areas are translating into incredible business performance. During the quarter, revenue increased 52% year-over-year to $316 million, yielding $39 million of adjusted EBITDA. The primary driver of our growth continues to be the expansion of our subscriber base. We ended the quarter with nearly 1.9 million subscribers adding more than 155,000 net new users to the platform. Our focus on providing access to high quality personalized solutions at an affordable price continues to resonate with consumers. Over 40% of subscribers in the second quarter were utilizing a personalized solution, representing close to a 30 point increase in just two years. An evolving portfolio of personalized offerings that providers can utilize to meet unique needs of individual consumers was a key catalyst behind this expansion. This innovation is informed in part by feedback from our users and development occurs through collaboration with our internal specialists, leading medical organization and external advisers. Increasingly, we are driving value for consumers across a broader set of specialties. Consumer feedback has been resoundingly positive, as we've launched access to treatments that address multiple concerns within its specialty and even more exciting, we now have solutions that span across specialties. This shows up in the ability to target multiple sexual health concerns, support cardiovascular health through a more simplified daily routine or address concerns across our most popular specialties concurrently in one solution. The combination of these multi-condition capabilities and access to a broader set of form factors is having a profound impact on the value we can provide to consumers. In dermatology, providers can prescribe users personalized sprays, serums or oral medications based on their unique needs. These capabilities enable us to cover a broader spectrum of user profiles. The individuals seeking to proactively prevent hair loss and an individual seeking to actively regrow hair, each now have access to a distinct set of solutions that better meet their needs. As a result, more than 85% of new subscribers in our dermatology specialties were utilizing a personalized solution in the second quarter. The impact of personalization extends beyond simply consumer preference. By addressing the needs of different user profiles, we are able to remove barriers to treatment for a broader set of individuals, ultimately yielding stronger customer acquisition. Additionally, we expect stronger retention of consumers on these offerings especially as they continue to be placed at more mass market price points. Investment in the expansion of these offerings will increase in the second half of the year. We expect to launch access to new multi-condition treatments with a particular focus on those that are inter specialty or enable expansion into adjacent markets. Additionally, new form factors across our specialties are expected in the second half. We believe this will allow us to scale our new verticals even faster, while also maintaining a robust growth for even our longest tenured specialties. Our strong financial profile has enabled us to capitalize on unique opportunities in order to position our platform for future growth. In 2021, we acquired Apostrophe, an Arizona-based 503(a) facility. This acquisition provided compounding capabilities and expertise that serve as the foundation for many of our personalized offerings today. We're excited to have recently signed an agreement to purchase an FDA registered 503(b) facility. Over the long term, this acquisition will present additional opportunities across specialties such as hormonal therapy and other treatments that require sterile compounded medications. In the near term, this further enhances the durability of our supply chain for compounded GLP-1s and positions us to improve accessibility as we verticalize these operations. Prior to signing this acquisition, we expanded the capabilities of our weight loss specialty with the launch of compounded GLP-1s across 21 states in the second quarter through a partnership with an FDA registered 503(b) facility. Since then, we have expanded access to the offering to more than 30 states, covering over 60% of the U.S. population, and we anticipate nationwide availability before year end. We believe that our platform was already having a meaningful impact across society prior to this launch by helping close to 2 million consumers access treatment for many of the most emotionally resonant conditions. We expect that the value we bring to consumers within our weight loss specialty will further enable us to have a transformative impact on society. Over 100 million individuals suffer with weight-related challenges in the U.S. alone, and those challenges don't simply impact an individual's appearance. These challenges can also erode confidence and lead to serious health related conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Given the impact of obesity can have on an individual and the severity of conditions it can lead to, we expect weight loss as a specialty to be foundational over the coming decade in the way Hims & Hers impacts the lives of our consumers in the way we influence the health care industry. Historically, weight related challenges have been viewed simply as a matter of lifestyle preference. GLP-1s have driven broader awareness that weight related issues can also be a medical condition. This has empowered more consumers to actively seek treatment even when GLP-1s are not the right fit. In the fourth quarter of last year, we launched our weight loss specialty with personalized oral-based solutions. This offering utilizes different combinations of personalized compounds to address the underlying conditions clinically tied to obesity, including metabolic disorders, depression and overeating habits. It has been incredibly successful. Within less than a year, it has scaled to a run rate of $100 million in annual revenue, becoming our fastest specialty ever to do so. Our approach centers on equipping providers with the ability to offer consumers access to a breadth of personalized solutions, and we expect the ability to personalize oral formulations will remain central to our weight loss offering and continue to evolve. We also believe our ability to provide consumers with access to personalized GLP-1 solutions will offer an experience and level of service that today is only available to the most privileged segments of our society. This approach is informed by Dr. Craig Primack, our SVP of Weight Loss, who have seen first-hand in the Scottsdale Clinic, the impact of personalized care model can have on providing a more sustainable path for a wider spectrum of consumers to reach the desired outcome. The side effects and misalignment of expectations drive a meaningful reduction in adherence for these solutions, alongside issues like cost and accessibility. We believe adherence to these medications can be improved considerably through consistent communication between providers and consumers to manage expectations, personalized titration schedules and personalized end dosing to mitigate side effect concerns. Each of our subscribers have the ability to communicate concerns to a licensed provider and receive a response in a timely manner for no extra charge across all of our specialties today. Personalization for GLP-1 solutions will be supported by two fundamental components. The first is the breadth of products offered on the platform. Recently, we launched personalized dosages for compounded semaglutide. The providers can prescribe in response to side effect concerns and desired levels of weight loss. Patient feedback to their provider during the titration process can inform the appropriate end state dose for users. Additionally, we're excited to expand the scope of offerings available on the platform and will look to add tirzepatide and liraglutide to the existing compounded semaglutide offering in the near future. We expect this portfolio of solutions will be inclusive of branded offerings when supply allows. The second component is continuing to scale our technology investments across weight loss, by activating MedMatch by Hims & Hers for providers in this specialty. Machine learning and AI models anchored on consumer preferences and prior experiences across our provider network have been built for weight loss. We are also moving toward integrating explainability into the EMR, further empowering providers with these groundbreaking tools. The value of this technology will be vital as the range of solutions, dosages and treatment options continue to expand over the coming quarters. With scale, we expect these models will continue to improve, helping providers to optimize initial medication selection, titration schedules and end state dosing to help each user reach their desired outcome. By leveraging this approach, we are providing a weight loss program that can continuously improve over time. Having said that, we have already started [Technical Difficulty] based upon self-reported data from approximately 12,000 customers subscribed a holistic Hims & Hers weight loss offering, customers report having lost on average 10.2 pounds while on compounded GLP-1 injections and 6.3 pounds, while on compounded oral medication kits between their initial weight loss consultation and their first check in approximately four weeks later. During the same period, less than 10% of customers using our compounded GLP-1 offering have reported side effects that they feel they can't tolerate. This progress underlines the importance of a holistic approach as each of our subscribers have access to personalized treatment plans based on lifestyle, eating pattern, health history and weight loss goals, and includes medications in addition to diet, exercise and weight loss counseling and support. We believe these figures are just the starting point for what we can help our customers achieve. By continuing to invest strategically in our technological infrastructure and further refining our approach, we believe we can deliver access to better outcomes than any other in-person or a digital provider over the long term. We are in a transformative moment in health care delivery in this country, and Hims & Hers is uniquely positioned to meet that moment and set the standard for what truly personalized care can look like for every household in the United States. We believe that we are transforming the way that consumers engage with their health and I look forward to extending this experience to an ever growing audience in the second half of 2024. With that, I will pass it over to Yemi to walk through our financials in greater detail.
Yemi Okupe: Thanks, Andrew. I will start by providing an overview of our second quarter financial performance and then discuss our updated outlook for 2024. In the second quarter, we continue to strengthen our leadership position across our specialties: mental health, sexual health, men's and women's dermatology and weight loss. Our strategy of democratizing access to high quality personalized solutions on our platform at an affordable price, continues to resonate with consumers, a rapidly evolving weight loss specialty that is inclusive of personalized oral solutions tailored to the underlying drivers in individuals weight challenges and the recently launched compounded GLP-1 offering is serving as an accelerant to what was already a phenomenal trajectory. In the second quarter, we were able to drive north of $300 million of revenue from our suite of offerings outside of GLP-1s. Fully consolidated revenue in the second quarter grew 52% year-over-year to $315.6 million, representing a 6 point acceleration in year-over-year growth relative to the prior quarter. Expansion of our online subscriber base continues to be the primary catalyst behind our incredible growth. Our subscriber base grew 43% year-over-year to $1.9 million. Growth in our subscriber base is being powered by two primary drivers: The first is an evolution of personalized solutions that continues to attract a broader base of consumers to the platform, as well as offer unique value propositions to our existing consumer base. As our offerings expand to encompass more multi-condition solutions, a broader set of form factors and customized dosages, we are seeing an increasing number of our existing subscribers switch to a personalized solution. Additionally, we are seeing new customers overwhelmingly utilize these options with more than 55% of new users in the second quarter, subscribing to a personalized solution. This has not only driven stronger retention across several specialties but has also enabled higher engagement levels than others. Prior to the launch of personalized solutions and sexual health, over 95% of consumers in the platform were using an on-demand solution reflective of broader market dynamics. During the second quarter, stronger value propositions resulted in over 40% of new sexual health users subscribing to solutions oriented around building a daily habit. Continued innovation and launches of new capabilities that will continue in the second half of the year, gives us conviction that there is a long runway of durable growth across even our most tenured specialties. A second primary driver of growth is our ability to combine our brand, breadth of personalized capabilities and past learnings to more rapidly scale new specialties. Our historical time frame for a new category to reach meaningful scale has been 1.5 to two years. In the fourth quarter of last year, we launched our weight loss specialty with a personalized set of oral-based treatments designed to address the underlying rate cause of an individual's weight gain. Almost 100,000 consumers has subscribed to our weight loss offering in just over seven months since launch. In the middle of the second quarter, we expanded this offering with the launch of compounded GLP-1 injections on the platform. We expect meaningful contributions from entire suite of solutions as we continue to evolve personalized oral based solutions as well as our GLP-1 offering. We believe that we are in the early innings of utilizing our platform to have a transformative impact on the way consumers receive treatment for some of the most emotionally resonate conditions. As a result, we continue to invest in growth but we remain committed to adhering to our rigorous capital allocation framework. We believe that adherence of this framework will enable us to continue to scale our platform while also expanding margins over the long term. Our performance in the second quarter is a sound demonstration of our ability to do so. In the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $39.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 6 points year-over-year to north of 12% as efficiency gains in operating expenses offset a slight degradation in gross margin. Gross margins were 81% in the second quarter. The addition of GLP-1s and growth of our broader weight loss specialty resulted in slight margin degradation. Early in a new offerings life cycle, margins are typically less favorable than the expected steady state margin profile. As we scale, we continue to see gains in efficiency on our cost structure. G&A costs improved 2 points year-over-year to 13% and operations and support costs improved 1 point year-over-year to 13%. We expect continued efficiency gains in these areas over the mid to long term. Marketing as a percentage of revenue improved nearly 6 points year-over-year to 46%, marking the lowest point in our history as a public company, a shifting mix toward personalized solutions combined with the seasoning of newer cohorts on favorable pricing is yielding stronger retention. We also continue to benefit from customer acquisition through lower cost channels as our brand continues to strengthen and we scale in categories that consumers are more open to speak with others about. Outstanding execution across the organization is resulting in strong free cash flow. This has allowed us to simultaneously strengthen our balance sheet strategically invest and return capital to shareholders. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $47.6 million, exceeding the entire amount of free cash flow generated in 2023. Cash and short-term investments expanded $24 million quarter-over-quarter to $227 million as a result. Before going into our outlook for the remainder of the year, I'd like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities and give additional insight into how we intend to utilize our balance sheet. As previously mentioned, we believe we are in the early innings of the adoption curve of a market with over 100 million potential users in the U.S. alone. As such, our first priority will remain on insuring that our platform has the ability to serve tens of millions of users across an expanding set of specialties. In addition to scaling overall capacity, this can take the form of many investments. Investments in affiliated pharmacies can unlock the ability to enable capabilities such as additional form factors, multi-condition treatments with greater manufacturing complexity and a broader set of personalized dosages on the platform. Scale allows us to automate affiliated facilities, and we are excited to embark on the next phase of that journey in the second half. Automation drives greater efficiency, enabling us to unlock more value for consumers in the platform and further strengthen our competitive position. Lastly, we will unlock new specialties and capabilities on the platform through both organic and inorganic means. The bar for M&A will remain high for us, we are willing to deploy our balance sheet towards high value assets that we feel will accelerate execution of our broader corporate strategy. As Andrew mentioned, we have entered into an agreement to acquire an FDA registered 503(b) facility. This sets the foundation for us to efficiently enter new specialties that require sterile compounded injectable and oral medications while also providing optionality for increased efficiency in the cost structure for compounded GLP-1s. Our expectation is that the deal will close by the end of this year. A rapidly expanding free cash flow profile will enable us to efficiently return capital to shareholders. In November of last year, we announced a $50 million share repurchase program. Market dynamics enabled us to repurchase 3.9 million shares at an average price of just under $13 since the inception of the program. In the second quarter, we purchased 1.6 million shares at an average price of $12.39, fully completing the program. The momentum of the business has enabled us to establish a new share repurchase program of $100 million to be utilized over the course of the next three years. This program will enable us to partially offset the effect of dilution from stock-based compensation as well as continue to take advantage of moments when we believe our share price is disconnected from its intrinsic value. We are confident that we can deliver across each of these objectives while also continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. With that backdrop, I'd like to detail our updated outlook for 2024. In the third quarter, we are anticipating revenue in the range of $375 million to $380 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 65% to 68%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $35 million to $40 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10% at the midpoint of both ranges. For the full year, we are anticipating revenue of between $1.37 billion to $1.4 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 57% to 61%. Lastly, we expect adjusted EBITDA will be between $140 million and $155 million. These adjusted EBIT and revenue ranges imply an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11% at the midpoint of both ranges. In the second half, we expect to have a broader set of personalized capabilities across our specialties. As a result of this and a more comprehensive weight loss offering, we anticipate more strategic investment in marketing in the back half of the year. This investment will still maintain our typical standard of a one year payback period. Our guidance last quarter of $1.2 billion to $1.23 billion of revenue and $120 million to $135 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2024, was in our view already ambitious. Given this is a meaningful revision from that, I will spend a brief moment outlining some of the underlying assumptions behind our revised outlook. We anticipate continued consumer adoption of personalized solutions through the remainder of the year. Our expectation is that we will have more than 1 million subscribers with a personalized subscription by the end of the year, close to the total number of subscribers we have on the platform just two years ago. Our weight loss specialty will continue to evolve throughout the year to leverage both our technology and personalized lines capabilities. As this happens, we expect rapid growth across the entire portfolio of offerings within the specialty. Utilization of third parties and other dynamics are expected to result in near-term gross margin erosion of 3 to 4 points that we expect to revert over the midterm. Long-term revenue retention is expected to remain north of 85%, ensuring durability while we scale the platform. Line of sight toward our first full year of net income profitability is becoming increasingly clear. As of the end of 2023, we had a tax valuation allowance of $70.5 million. If our financial trajectory holds, it is likely to result in a reversal of the vast majority of this allowance has more certainty around profitability and our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets when they get the need for this allowance. This is apt to drive a significant onetime increase in net income later this year. This will not impact any of the previously discussed ranges. 2024 is setting a strong foundation for the attainment of our midterm goals and fulfillment of our longer-term mission. Investments today give us conviction that we will achieve our goal of adjusted EBITDA margins of at least 20%, no later than 2030. More exciting is that this extraordinary momentum increases our ability to have a transformative impact on society by bringing the value of our platform to tens of millions of consumers. All of this would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of our employees across Hims & Hers. I'd like to thank them as well as our shareholders for helping us fulfill our mission of helping the world feel great through the power of better health. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Maria Ripps from Canaccord. Your line is open.
Maria Ripps: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions and congrats on the strong performance here. So I appreciate all the color around your guidance. It sounds like your core business continues to do really well. Is there any color you can able to share with us in terms of projected GLP revenue contribution for the second half of the year that's embedded in your full year outlook? And then secondly, how would this acquisition of the outsourcing facility impact your gross margins and sort of unit economics longer term?
Yemi Okupe: Thanks for the question, Maria. This is Yemi. I’d say, overall, I think we're very excited by how the core business is performing. In the second quarter, as mentioned, the core business, excluding GLP-1s delivered north of $300 million of revenue. What we're expecting in the second half of the year as we'll continue to innovate on the suite of personalized offerings across the core business. And so we do expect the momentum to remain strong from there. With respect to GLP-1 specific contributions, I think we're very much in the early days of the GLP-1 launch being less than three months out from the launch. In the second quarter, we did see very strong momentum. I think it’s too early at this point to provide definitive guidance around a specific specialty or product, but we’re very pleased off of the initial launch and the confidence in the momentum for that specific vertical is very strong as we roll out the product nationally. With respect to your second question around gross margins, I think that typically, as we do see specialties and products within specialty scale. We historically look for opportunities to optimize the margin for those products that can be in the form of processes that we change or increasingly, as you see across other specialties, the verticalization, and so I think that the acquisition that we mentioned around the 503(b) facility that will do a few things. I think it will unlock the ability to enter additional specialties within the future. But also, I think it does provide opportunity for us to optimize the cost structure on the compounded GLP-1 offering.
Maria Ripps: Got it. Thank you so much, Yemi.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Allen Lutz from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Allen Lutz: Hi. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. One for Yemi. You talked about more strategic marketing investment in the back half of the year. Can you talk about just generally as we think about the total investment in the second half of the year, potential impacts from the election, how should we think about where those marketing dollars are going in GLP-1s versus the core. And then you also mentioned 30 states are live today for GLP-1, you expect that to get to 50 by the end of the year. How much of the incremental marketing spend is going to new states? Just really trying to understand the breakdown as we think about the next six months, how much of your marketing dollars are going towards the GLP-1 business? Thanks.
Yemi Okupe: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Allen. I think it's a really good question. I think so the way that we think are marketing is, I think there are a few dimensions. There is a component that can be GLP-1 specific that's in the form of traditional pay channels. But just stepping back, I think one of the beauties of the Hims & Hers platform is the fact that we have a multi-specialty offering, we have the ability to connect with users across a multitude of specialties. And so I think a lot of the investment will come as we start to broaden the aperture of a number of personalized solutions that we have even across the core set of specialties as well as in our weight loss offering. Increasingly, you'll see a meaningful portion of the spend go towards speaking to the multi-condition capabilities that you see across Hims & Hers. We've also left ourselves some room just given the fact that regarding election year and this is new, some flexibility in that dimension. We do anticipate a meaningful portion of the spend to come more in the form of speaking to consumers around the broader capabilities of the platform, weight in GLP1 inclusive of that. I think that kind of just to provide a firm of reference for how we think around it. I think we will still be very disciplined with the overall spend structure. It will maintain the one year payback period. We'll also look to position ourselves from economies of scale. And so I think it's a similar dynamic to what we saw in the back half of 2022, and the front half of 2023 where as we started to see new capabilities in the platform scale, we leaned in to a variety of different channels. I think we're expecting that in the second half and then expect to see leverage of the 1 points to 3 points that we mentioned on a per annum basis on marketing for the next couple of years.
Allen Lutz: Great. And then one for Andrew. Can you just talk about the broader GLP-1 strategy? I think it's obvious we've gotten a lot of questions around the durability of this opportunity. How should we think about Hims ability to stay in the GLP-1 market in a scenario where these drugs are taken off the shortage list? Thanks.
Andrew Dudum: Yeah. Thanks, Allen. [Technical Difficulty] I'd start by saying we're currently still seeing and wouldn't expect this change thousands of patients coming to us every day, struggling to get access to these GLP-1s, including tirzepatide, which has caused a lot of these in the last couple of days. I think given the breadth of the portfolio that we have and this is inclusive of the personalized oral compounds, which as we shared in the remarks has grown in $100 million run rate business, our fastest specialty alone. But in addition to the oral compound, the branded medications, the personalized GLP-1 doses, which augment the commercially available dosages for patients that need it as well as off-patent GLP-1s like liraglutide, I think we believe the combination of that portfolio allows customers and providers are really robust range of offerings that we think is very durable. I think this will exist and expand beyond the shortage dynamics. I think there's really established precedent with regard to the compounding exception, which allows for this level of personalization that we've spoken about for patients that need it. And I would expect that the clinical necessity of that will be really clear with these medications as people know, there are real side effects. There are really no one size fits all dynamic. But we think there’s a really robust platform that extends well beyond the shortage across a number of these avenues.
Allen Lutz: Great. Thanks, Andrew.
Andrew Dudum: Thanks, Allen.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Wallace from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
Jack Wallace: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a great quarter. Just wanted to follow up to that last question and maybe ask the personalization element in a different way. Is there a -- the existing product in the market or existing form factor, is that enough to be personalized or is it through a personalized dosing regimen, personalized enough to operate under a personalization exemption after the drugs are off the shortage list or do they need to be further personalization enhancements to make that possible? And as a follow-up to that, how much is the MedMatch capability and the data you're collecting on the platform going to be empowering those personalization enhancements to the medication? Thank you.
Andrew Dudum: Yeah. Thanks, Jack for the question. The short answer is that the compounded exemption, it's relatively clear, and there's been decades of established precedent with regard to what qualifies as personalized. And this often is a form factor, as you outlined or it could be dosing dynamics of a patient is not getting the outcome that they're hoping for, are they experiencing side effects that are intolerable. So these types of customizations are relatively well established and I think the clinical necessity of compounding and the clinical necessity of personalizing medication is really well established, right? This is not overwhelmingly the case. But in many ways, you personalized dosages augment (ph) what is commercially available. And so I think our personalization dosages that exist on the platform today are offering fantastic high touch care to patients that otherwise really wouldn't be able to experience the benefits of GLP-1. And I would expect in the future in a post shortage world, this also continues to exist for patients as an access point. With regard to MedMatch, I think what is happening right now is that there's an expansion of, and a breadth of options that we are bringing to the market in the second half of this year and the next year across all avenues. This is oral compounds new combination therapies on the oral side. This is branded medications when available medications [Technical Difficulty] like liraglutide. And so, the breadth is only expanding the range of dosages is only expanding on the platform, which gives providers and patients that level of nuance that we think is really, really critical. And when you match that [Technical Difficulty] the capabilities of MedMatch to help identify the right [indiscernible], the right end dose, the right adjustments as necessary for a patient. We think that combination is incredibly strong. And the data today already suggests patients are having really world-class experiences. But long term, honestly, we believe the combination of that breadth of portfolio and MedMatch together will be able to hopefully result in clinical outcomes that are far superior than you can get not only in brick-and-mortar, but also via any online type telemedicine provider.
Jack Wallace: All right. Got you. That's helpful. Thank you. And then Yemi, just a quick two-parter on the guide. Just wanted to make sure I heard it correctly. For the gross margin erosion in the back half of the year from the launch in categories. Is that a second half versus first half comparison or is that a full year comparison? And I'll leave it there.
Yemi Okupe: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Jack. Yeah, it’s a first half versus second half comparison. And so I think in the near term, while we look to optimize the cost structure for overall weight category, specifically GLP-1s, we do expect some compression, but I think that we do expect that to revert in the midterm once some of the investments that we mentioned earlier start to come online.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Grosslight from Citi. Your line is open.
Daniel Grosslight: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I know you probably haven't gotten this question in about a year now, but it seems like everyone is thinking about this at least today, a weakening economy and a potential recession, I'm curious, if you've seen any signs out there of a slacking in consumer demand? And if so, if you can kind of describe where that stock might be coming in? Hello?
Yemi Okupe: Hey, Dan. This is Yemi. Thanks for the question. I think overall, in the second quarter, we've not seen any meaningful degradation from the consumer. I think that similar to during other periods of economic uncertainty, we do see the consumer continue to remain durable. I think there's a few reasons behind this. One is just the diversity and the breadth of the consumers that we serve across different end ranges, income levels, geographic locations is pretty broad. The second is that we serve consumers across a wide variety of some of the most emotionally resonant conditions that impact how they look, how they fill each and every day. And so we've observed historically during these moments of economic uncertainty is that consumers are very reticent to let that go. We are continuously excited by some of the optimization around with our cost structure, being able to place even some of the most personalized products at more and more attractive price points that are transparent and provide consumers with access to a holistic solution from being able to match their providers, to been able to leverage the technology across the platform to get matched with an attractive solution at a price point that is oftentimes less than the collection of deductibles for them to do so. And so overall, we've not seen a slowdown. And I think based upon what we've seen historically during these periods of economic uncertainty, we do have very high conviction in the ability for consumers to continue to come to the platform and ultimately for the platform to continue to grow.
Daniel Grosslight: Got it. Okay. And Andrew as well, you both mentioned more folks coming to the platform, taking a product that cuts across categories or a single product that cuts across categories. I'm curious if you can provide an update on how many folks are taking multiple drugs across categories or single drug across categories? And then of the folks who have come in for GLPs, have any of them converted to other products in other categories?
Andrew Dudum: Thanks, Daniel. I can kick it off. On the personalization side and the cross category side, we don't disclose specifically the specialty mixes and how those cross, but I would point to the pretty rapid acceleration of personalized adoption, we shared 55% of new subscribers are now planned personalized products and 40% of the entire [Technical Difficulty]. This is pretty astronomical speed and acceleration relative to the last year. So I think [Technical Difficulty] many of which specialty case customization and aggregation across specialties. I think specifically on the weight category, these patents that have really complex mix of these issues. I think [Technical Difficulty] the oral compounded category that we have had scaled so quickly and have had such great success. It's because it's really treating many underlying conditions, right? And it could be depressive eating dynamics, binge eating, metabolic disorders, insulin resistance, and so I think for the obesity category in general, I would expect there to be very significant cross category and cross specialty concerns whereby both the oral combination through compounding therapies as well as the bundling options, there is ability for us to treat a person more holistically because I think the patient, frankly, will just necessitate it. I think these patients more than many – more than maybe any patient we’ve seen on the platform is requiring a more holistic approach, which I think will then be reflected in the bundles and offerings and compounds that you will see the company bring to market.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonna Kim from TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Jonna Kim: Thanks for taking my question. Could you just provide additional color around the unit economics of the GLP-1s and how you're able to offer the GLP-1s at a current pipeline that are way below others in the market? And Yemi would love to get additional color around how -- what you're assuming around monthly revenues and subscriber adds in your guide? Thank you so much.
Yemi Okupe: Yeah. Thanks so much for the question, Jonna. I think what we -- how we're able to offer the structure that we are or the pricing that we are around GLP-1 is really just a reflection of the benefits from the scale that we have today, just given how the number of consumers on our platform, that enables us when we do partnerships with third parties to negotiate across the supply chain, a cost structure that enables us to place it at these price points. I think what's even more exciting is, with our scale, with our balance sheet, we're able to make investments in the future that provide line of sight to an increasingly strong set of unit economics. And so I think as the cost structure stands today, on a gross margin basis, GLP-1s, do you have a dilutive effect on the gross margins, I think we're confident that as we continue to make investments in verticalization, optimizing processes, continuing to look for optimization opportunities across the logistics, the economics and what we've observed in other specialties as they started to season the bid will only mature. And so I think that the price points that we put the GLP-1s at are a reflection of us being able to utilize this muscle historically in the past. With respect to some of the dynamics in the back half of the year around gross subscriber adds and monthly average revenue per subscriber. We don't necessarily give specific guidance there, but I can speak to what are some of the broad trends and themes that we do expect. Overall, I think resonantly we do expect the vast majority of growth to continue to come from subscribers coming on to the platform and increasingly stronger and stronger levels, that set in, there are a few different dynamics that we do expect will lead to growth in the monthly average revenue per subscriber. The price point of the overall weight category on a monthly basis, roughly $79 a month for the oral compounds to as low as $199 per month on the GLP-1 offering. While that is very attractive for the overall market, it is accretive to the price points that the rest of the core business is offered at. And so as the weight offering continues to scale, we would expect upward dynamics on the monthly average revenue per subscriber in the back half of the year. Additionally, we do see more and more users each quarter opt for personalized solutions. That's coming from new users that increasingly are opting for those solutions as well as existing users making the switch as there's more and more value offered to our consumers. And so as we look to launch more unique form factors as we also look to launch more personalized offerings that cut across multiple conditions. We would expect that trend to continue to accelerate in the back half of the year, which would again lead to some tailwinds on the monthly average revenue per subscriber. So that is an element on monthly average revenue per subscriber that we do expect to elevate and increase in the back half of the year, but we still do expect the vast majority of growth to come from new subscriber additions onto the platform.
Jonna Kim: Got it. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler from Seaport. Your line is open.
Aaron Kessler: Hey, guys. Great. A couple of questions. Maybe first just on the guidance. I heard kind of a personalized solutions in terms of the increased revenue. Would you attribute to any categories as well? Is it mostly weight loss or is it really across categories? And then just maybe any updates on some of your other key categories, including dermatology, mental health and sexual health as well? Thank you.
Yemi Okupe: Well, maybe let Andrew speak to like the broader dynamics and then I can cut into some of the more detailed nuances there.
Andrew Dudum: Yeah. Great. Aaron, thanks for the question. I think across categories, it's been [Technical Difficulty] offerings. We talked about on the domestic health side [Technical Difficulty] now offering and engaging with personalized product is up 3 times year-over-year. In particular, what's really interesting is, it's not just personalized, but it's actually more engaged behavior. So on the demand side of the business, [Technical Difficulty] one-off daily or one-off [Technical Difficulty] if you think about [Technical Difficulty] transform that business much value in personal [Technical Difficulty] were multi-specialty multi-cap [Technical Difficulty] in high engagement leading to personalized outcome, but in any [Technical Difficulty] outcome, which we think is really powerful. And this is taking place across the spectrum 80%, 90% of that business now is open for a personalized solution. [Technical Difficulty] already a very robust, set of categories.
Yemi Okupe: Yeah. I think just a follow-up on that Aaron, because I think Andrew was breaking up a bit. I think we do expect the adoption of personalization to cut across most of the specialties. What we have seen is that as we continue to elevate the breadth of choices both in terms of new form factors or offering products within conditions that offer multiple sources of value within a specialty. We see more and more consumers opt to switch to those, what we also do expect is in the back half of the year, the innovation will accelerate across multiple of our specialties. Additionally, we do expect in the back half of the year is for the ability to bring solutions that cut across popular specialties concurrently. And so with that, we do expect more and more consumers to either revert to that, whether that's new users that are opting for more of the solutions with greater frequency or our existing users switch. And so an example of what we've seen that Andrew mentioned in his prepared remarks is in the sexual health business, we've seen a rapid uptick in the adoption of personalized products as we brought on solutions like the Hardman's or the multi-condition solutions such as the heart health products. As a result of that, we've seen more and more folks opt to switch to a daily habit and especially that's historically been more of an on-demand type of dynamic. And so we're confident in the back half of the year. But as that value continues to broaden more and more users across all of our specialties will do so. In the weight management category, I think we're very excited by that. And similar to our mental health category, when you're able to combine our ability to offer a very broad set of personalized solutions with technology that can assist providers in matching consumers to the solution that is likely to yield successful results with potentially less side effects. We generally see that, that yields to a few things. One is it just fosters a greater build of consumer trust. Also we do see is that the retention as a result of the stronger value proposition as well as the dynamics of being able to mitigate side effect concerns or meet consumers what their preference is, that generally yields to both stronger retention as well as acquisition. And so we’re very excited by the portfolio that’s to come in the second half of the year.
Aaron Kessler: Great. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.
Michael Cherny: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I want to come back to this dynamic of the, I guess, call it, multiyear long-term components of your GLP-1 business within weight management. I know some questions have been asked about the patent protection and where you sit. If you can maybe give us some examples, given this is obviously still an evolving market on where you've seen some of these dynamics put in place? I mean, you obviously have the ability to scale well. But I think also companies like Lilly and Novo are clearly going to go out of the way to protect the franchises they have. And also, I know that you have the ability to offer branded components over time. So I guess along all those lines, how should we expect all of this dynamic to develop relative to your product availability, the mix of compounded versus traditional brand over time and where you sit in the marketplace, knowing some of the dynamics around their focus on their patent tickets?
Andrew Dudum: Thanks, Michael. I'll take a crack. I think at a high level, you should expect some degree of fluidity right over the next couple of years, just given I think there's going to be not only a changing market dynamic with the current medication that are on shortage. But I think there's also probably going to be five or 10 new medications that come to market in the next few years, just given if you look at the clinical studies and the FDA pipeline. So I think you're looking at five to 10 years of innovation, all kind of expanding off of the initial GLP-1 learning and that first medication out there with liraglutide now coming off time. So I think what you can expect is some fluidity without question, where I think we get a lot of confidence is that there's a really broad set of offerings under the hood that we believe in combination results in a really durable business line. As we talked about, the oral compounds that we have launched, that is -- that in and about itself is the fastest growing specialty we've ever launched on the platform, achieving north of $100 million run rate just in six or seven months. We expect huge evolutions in that platform and expansion of offerings there that patients really do love and are having great outcomes. And then on the injectable side, I think there's going to be, without question, a long horizon of on and off availability, just given the demand. We see thousands of patients coming every single day saying that they can't get access to these medications. And so we suspect that we'll be able to offer commercially available doses to in some form for extended periods. I think on top of that, as you said, as supply grows, we are excited to bring the branded medications for patients that are interested on to the platform as well as the personalized dosages. The compounding [Technical Difficulty] titration and dose customization exists and operates regardless of shortage. This is an exemption for which we operate the entire business under and have for the last six or seven years. And there's really an established precedent where everybody in market really respect the clinical need of personalization and realizes that often these personalized dosages augment what is commercially available and are not directly cannibalizing large pharma. So when you think about very few, if any examples, where large pharma comes after legitimate clinically necessary compounding and what we're seeing on our platform is that for these medications, that clinical customization is definitely needed for some patients. And we believe in combination with the rest of the portfolio, that will be included and available to patients over a long period of time.
Michael Cherny: So maybe if I can ask one more quick question, especially given your future offerings. What is your current day-day relationship like with Lilly and Novo. And how much are you preparing for that brand offering as some of the products come off shortage?
Andrew Dudum: Yes, it's a great question. As you guys probably saw, we recently brought on Kare Schultz to the Board who is there for north of 20, 25 years as President and COO. I think we are sitting in the same place as almost everybody in market, which is trying to get supply for the branded medication. We -- that some customers will, without question wants easy, quick application of the self-inject pen. They know the brand, they trust the brand and they see all the benefits of that medication and they want those medications. So we, I think, like many others, if not almost everybody, are trying our best to source supply. I think what we can tell you is that it's not easy. There’s not really any available in volume, but we are doing our best to try to aggregate some and have a durable supply of that for our customers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jailendra Singh from Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Jailendra Singh: Thank you and thanks for taking my questions. One follow-up on gross margin trends. I know I'm making some assumptions here, but I'm getting low to mid-50% gross margin on GLP-1 offering in the quarter. Just to confirm if I'm in the ballpark, it seems to expect the margins to improve on this offering as you kind of bring a 503(b) outsourcing facility on board. So on that point, does owning that facility in any way impact your relationship and economics with BPI labs, the facility you currently have agreement with and how quickly can you shift volume to your own facility? Just trying to understand if there are any contractual agreements with your existing partner, which would put any restrictions on how aggressively you can leverage your own facility?
Yemi Okupe: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Jailendra. I think we don't comment on the specific gross margins for any individual product. Like most other products in the near term, we do see some degree of gross margin degradation. I think that as products tend to season in their tenure there's a multitude of different levers that we have to pull to improve the unit economics. This is everything from being able to intelligently adjust information and product dynamics so that the consumer to reduce customer service cost, you've been able to optimize on the logistics of the supply chain, automating some of the facilities through verticalization. Those have been historical levers that we've pulled in the past. I think we're confident in our ability to do each of those over time with GLP-1s. In the near term, we do expect to see some gross margin compression, but as we start to go out into next year, the ability to start to deploy multiple of those levers does come into play. And so I think as Andrew has mentioned, historically in the past, as we make investments, we tend to think about them on multiyear horizons and look to have multiple different angles to do so. And so while GLP-1 scale in the near term, there's roughly the -- couple of points of degradation in the back half of this year that we're expecting. We do expect in the midterm as we start to optimize some of those efficiency levers inclusive of the verticalization that we have the ability to revert that. But there's no like individual lever, it's only verticalization or it's only optimization in terms of our processes. We have the ability to pull multiple levers and expand the margins over time.
Jailendra Singh: Just to clarify, there's no restriction from your existing pharmacy partner to shift any volume, right?
Yemi Okupe: We don't speak to the specific dynamics around what happens or what the partnership arrangement looks like for any individual partner. That said, I think that what we do expect is there's a period of time for us to close the deal. There's also the period of time for us to invest accordingly to be able to scale up appropriately. I think that those dynamics we do expect to occur more in the midterm. And so as those occur, we would expect the gross margins to expand.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Glen Santangelo: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple for me. Hey, Yemi. I want to follow up on subscribers to the compounded GLP-1 product. Are many of the taking advantage of multi-month subscriptions. Could you give us a little bit more about the demographic of these types of subscribers? And like, on average, how many months are they buying at a time? Anything you can tell us to help us think about that? And then I have a quick follow-up.
Yemi Okupe: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Glen. We do see the vast majority of subscribers on the -- just the overall weight management solution, both inclusive of oral as well as GLP-1s up for multi months. What you do see is I think at the price points as you make longer-term commitments tend to be more attractive. What we also do see is that this is a product across all of the way through oral and GLP-1s, it does require multiple months of commitment to really get to the appropriate titration schedule and see the effects emerge. And so as a result of that, we do see the overwhelmingly majority of consumers opt for a multi-month, a multi-month solution.
Glen Santangelo: Yeah, that's what I thought. So my follow-up question is, I guess, how the months of this compounded semaglutide can you ship it once. And then when I think about the revenue recognition, sort of related to that, if you ship three months at once, you book all three months of the revenue upfront or any sort of clarity on how that works? I mean, I think that would help us a lot from a modeling perspective. Thanks. I’ll stop there.
Yemi Okupe: Yeah. So I think that the short answer is, I think that the number of months that we ship does vary state to state. Typically, we -- depending on the duration that the individual selects we do typically ship between three months or no more than six months historically. What we do see as an effect of that across the oral as well as the GLP-1 solution. Is it as more and more consumers are opting for longer duration subscriptions that exceed 90 days, you do see the deferred revenue component start to increase on the balance sheet as a result of that as well. So typically, it's going to be within the three to six months timeframe beyond that, particularly given the product costs specifically for GLP-1s, we typically don't extend beyond that type of cadence. And so the effect of that would be is, if consumers continue to take on longer cadences, you would expect to see deferred revenue expand from quarter-to-quarter on the balance sheet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
George Hill: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. First, just a point of clarification. I want to make sure I heard you guys right that you said you're tracking towards 1 million weight loss subscribers by the end of the year. And then, if I have that number or if I have wrong, you can just correct me on what it was. But I'm just interested in the mix. I guess, if you can talk about how many of those people are on GLP-1 or probably GLP-1s versus other drugs? And then within the GLP-1 category, there's the compounded product versus the injection product, you guys draw a differentiation there? And then looking forward, Yemi or Andrew, I'd love to hear you guys talk a little bit about like how you expect the business mix to evolve in that category.
Yemi Okupe: Maybe I can take the front half of that question. Just to clarify, I think it was -- George, it was 1 million personalized subscribers. And Andrew can go into the way specifics.
George Hill: Okay. So I missed. Sorry about that.
Andrew Dudum: Yeah. Thank you, George. I think long term, I would suspect like we see across almost every one of our specialties, pretty vast diversity within the offering. You see that already within the weight loss specialty as we talked about the oral compounds in of themselves growing very, very quickly, the fastest we've ever had as a specialty north of $100 million run rate just in six to seven months. And I think as we continue to expand the options on that side as well as off-patent medications like liraglutide and the branded mix, we've always seen historically great variation. When we look back, for example, on our sexual health side of the business, we have branded Viagra, we had generic Viagra, we had custom compounds. And you see just really no concentration. And I think if we're doing our job well, there is no concentration because we are expanding into further segments that better serve each customer. And I think that's really how we think about our product roadmap approach, which is, if there's a large segment of customers that is on a current medication, let's really get to know those customers. Let's figure out how we can make their experience better, what other conditions or specialties are struggling with, what other types of concerns do they have? And how can we optimize even further the adherence and the clinical outcomes. So I would suspect, like all other specialties, you'll get to pretty wide variation. What is abundantly clear is that while GLP-1s are incredible medications, I think what's even more incredible is that they have really changed the cultural conversation around obesity management. You now have tens of thousands of people coming to us every week that are looking to get treated for obesity as a disease, and I think that stigma and that shame associated with taking action and pharmaceutical action to treat weight losses has really been diminished, which is fantastic because I think it just really empowers people to get care. And so the awareness of the disease state as something that is treatable in of itself is driving really tremendous interest and exploration. And then I think on top of that, what we're seeing is -- there's a lot of people that come in who are at very different stages of their process, right? Many people have come in and have tried everything, and they want to be the most impressive as possible. And often that means going with something like a Zepbound, right, highest chance of weight loss, self-inject, right? These things are actually quite scary for a lot of people, and many of them come in and say, hey, I want to go a little bit slower. I want something that involves an oral medication or something that I can chew or dissolve them on the tongue that might not be as extreme but is much more known and has been around for decades, and we see every customer in and between that spectrum. So there’s not only a product mix that takes place, but there’s really a customer mix because in this category, it is so large that it really represents such a massive part of the country and everybody is coming in at a very different point in their cycle and is looking to be different levels of aggressive with different types of caution and perspective.
George Hill: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Korinne Wolfmeyer: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Could you provide a little bit of color on the cadence of sign-ups with the GLP-1s that you saw right after launching, I know you're still in early days, but have you seen any change in kind of the monthly sign-ups since that launch? And then how has the retention been for those GLP-1 patients so far? Thanks.
Yemi Okupe: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Korinne. I think what we have seen since the launch, and we saw this with the oral medications as well is the vast majority or over majority of folks are selecting multi-month cadences across the platform. Again, I think a lot of that is due to the nature of to truly see the benefits from these medications. Oftentimes, it does take longer than an individual month. Consumers do recognize that in the education process from providers and throughout the flow as they're going through the journey. I think that dynamic paired with the more favorable economics of the consumer with longer-term cadences that you commit to as resulting in an overwhelmingly majority of the consumers opting for longer duration cadences. We're very much in the early days where the product has been in market for a little less than three month at this point. I think that what we are seeing is based upon the cadence that users are selecting as well as the feedback that users are giving to their providers and the check in. We are confident that retention will be very strong and sound. But that said, I think we have less than three months of data at this point. So it's truly hard to get a meaningful read there.
Korinne Wolfmeyer: Great. Thank you. And then could you just let us know that regarding the news from Lilly last week and the improvement in capacity there, did you alter your internal expectations, I guess, for both this year and next year following that announcement or is that kind of a non-event for -- related to your guidance? Thank you.
Andrew Dudum: Yemi might be on mute. But I would say, Korinne, I don’t think there’s a material expectations that, that alters guidance. As you can tell from the current business, [indiscernible] are the only GLP-1s currently on the offering and platform today. And so I think all of that was built into the existing forecast.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",split transcript is available for premium subscribers only.,HIMS
2024,Q3,2024-11-04,"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. My name is Krista, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Hims & Hers Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Bill Newby, Head of Investor Relations. Bill, you may begin.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Andrew.
Andrew Dudum: Thanks, Bill. Strong momentum from last quarter continued into the second half as we further expanded capabilities on our platform to help millions of consumers feel great through the power of better health. We made considerable progress across several dimensions that consumers value, including the speed with which they can access providers and personalized solutions to address their needs, the convenience and transparency provided by our world-class technology platform, and lastly, the breadth of personalized solutions that enables them to address concerns across our specialties in a more unique and customized way. Ongoing success in the delivery against our mission is translating into exceptional business results. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated 25 points quarter-over-quarter to 77% as we surpassed $400 million in revenue in the quarter. A disciplined approach to investment enabled us to surpass $50 million in adjusted EBITDA, reflecting a 13% adjusted EBITDA margin. Our strategy of offering high-quality personalized solutions at mass-market prices continues to resonate with consumers. We ended the third quarter with over two million subscribers and north of 50% of subscribers utilizing a personalized solution. We believe there are four primary factors driving rapid adoption of personalized solutions. The first is a continuous expansion of personalized solutions within new specialties. During the third quarter, we launched access to personalized titration schedules and dosing for semaglutide within weight loss. The second is scaling the number of compelling multi-condition solutions available on our platform that draw in a broader set of users. This includes access to personalized treatments that address multiple concerns both within and across specialties. The third is a wider selection of form factors, unlocking access to solutions that can now be utilized via chewable or topical solution, and in the near-future, gummy. And finally, as these solutions and our underlying capabilities expand, we're able to offer them at more accessible price points, strengthening a high-value proposition for our customers that we believe is unmatched. Each of these developments allows us to service a broader set of consumer needs, which we believe will ultimately support more consumers sticking with their treatments and achieving positive outcomes. All of our specialties have benefited from this innovation, and we are seeing it have significant impact on the Hers brand. I've always believed that the Hers brand had the potential to eventually match, if not surpass the size of the Hims brand, as we surpassed 400,000 Hers subscribers in the third quarter across specialties such as dermatology [technical difficulty] it is becoming increasingly clear that this area of our business is at an inflection point. In response to this accelerating trajectory, we are excited to announce the addition of Dr. Jessica Shepherd, who recently joined us as Chief Medical Officer of Hers. A Board-certified Ob/Gyn, Dr. Shepherd has served patients for nearly 20 years across health issues top-of-mind for women, including endometriosis, sexual health, menopausal health, fibroids, and narrowing health disparities for women. More recently, she has run a clinic that has offered personalized solutions across weight management, hormonal therapy, and dermatology. Our expanding platform continues to make significant strides in unlocking access to a level of care that has historically been available to only the most privileged segments of society. As our platform continues to scale, we are seeing an increased ability to reach some of the most vulnerable populations across America. We've seen an increase in individuals from less affluent communities joining and retaining on our platform, as we have made access to personalized solutions and high-quality care available at mass market prices. We ended the third quarter with over 400,000 subscribers on the platform, from this terms where the average household income is below $50,000 with nearly 40,000 of those subscribers in weight loss. Similarly, we are seeing an increase in subscribers from older communities, where we often see mobility issues, financial constraints, and in the case of weight loss, lack of Medicare coverage present barriers to treatment. Over 100,000 of our subscribers as of quarter end are over the age of 65, with nearly 7,000 of those accessing a weight-loss solution. And finally, many individuals who spend their lives caring for others and keeping our country safe and healthy often face robots when seeking access to medical care. This includes teachers that educate our communities, first responders that save lives and military personnel and veterans that keep us safe. I'm incredibly proud of our service appreciation initiative, which launched on September 18 and allows us to offer U.S. military veterans, teachers, nurses, and first responders access to personalized compounded GLP-1 weight-loss solutions for as low as $99 per month. Underpinning our ability to bring this type of value to our consumers is scale. And more importantly, scale that is supported by a continuously advancing technology platform. Our platform is enabling us to democratize a high standard of care historically accessible by only a small population. Consumers on our platform have the ability to message providers and generally address concerns within hours as opposed to days or weeks. Access follow-up care on-demand, which is especially beneficial in high-touch areas like mental health and weight loss. And seamlessly access providers from the comfort of their own home outside of traditional working hours, minimizing disruption to income from time-loss commuting or sitting in a waiting room. We believe this has translated into remarkable success by drawing new customers to the platform and providing the kind of personalized support we believe is critical for patient adherence and positive outcomes. I'd like to pass it over to our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Patrick Carroll, to briefly talk through some of the dynamics we're seeing in some of our higher-touch specialties.
Patrick Carroll: Thanks, Andrew. Over the course of 40 years of running my own medical practice and overseeing healthcare institutions, I have heard again and again that one of the deepest desires for medical providers was to spend more time with patients and offer them a deeper level of care. There are several hurdles that impact disability for medical providers, which unfortunately only increased for many in recent years. These include first, the time medical providers lose across their day as a result of navigating numerous administrative tasks with inefficient tools. And the need to operate on a non-intuitive technological platforms that are not designed for patients or providers. Hims & Hers' ability to remove these hurdles through thoughtful business practices and innovative technology centered on providing exceptional care to patients has unlocked an ability for medical providers to offer a deeper level of care to patients. This has been particularly transformational in traditionally higher touch areas such as weight loss. We believe GLP-1s have the ability to have a tremendous impact on society. However, several barriers prevent them from unlocking their full potential. Studies have shown that intolerable side effects like gastrointestinal issues and substantial muscle loss, less-than-desired frequency of engagement with providers, and lack of access to affordable solutions result in less than 70% of patients continuing the medication after four weeks of treatment. That number falls further to 42% by 12 weeks. Across the Hims & Hers platform, we have seen strong retention rates for compounded GLP-1 solutions. At four weeks, 85% of GLP-1 patients are engaging with the platform, including through continuation of care, completing a check-in, a proactive engagement with the provider. By 12 weeks, we observed 70% of patients continuing with their subscription. We believe there are four primary drivers of these great results. First, our platform enables consistent provider communication. By four weeks, patients have typically had at least three engagements with the provider on the platform, and by 12 weeks, they've had an average of five engagements. Once a patient reaches the end of their titration schedule, providers still engage with patients on average of at least once a month. This level of service would be incredibly challenging to offer at scale to the average consumer in the typical brick-and-mortar setting. Second, technology on our platform removes administrative overhead on providers and equips them with products and tools to better address individual patient needs. Providers on the Hims & Hers platform have access to tools with our proprietary EMR that automate notes on patients, programmatically flag certain risk and leverage structured data to help them highlight important concerns and dynamics for providers. Additionally, capabilities such as MedMatch by Hims & Hers, our proprietary AI technology, support providers in identifying ways to balance weight loss results with the side effect management, including medication and titration schedule adjustments. Third, a wide breadth of personalized doses options means that providers on our platform can serve a broader set of patients. Standard doses will work for many patients, however, given the diversity of obesity challenges across the American population and the concerns many have with common side effects, like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle loss or sarcopenia, we expect there are millions of individuals who stand to benefit from personalized dosages. Finally, based on customer-reported data from more than 10,000 subscribers on a personalized weight loss program who have reached their 28-day check-in and several thousand of those who have reached a 56-day check-in, these patients are seeing results and are indicating they are excited to continue accomplishing their goals. We have seen customers lose on average of 4.1% of their initial body weight in their first four weeks, while customers who have reached the eight-week mark have lost 5.5% of their initial body weight. We believe the clinical benefits of the care and personalized solutions available through our platform are clear as we are seeing more consumers continue with their medication schedules and report positive outcomes. While both our mental health and weight loss specialties are in their early innings, I am excited by the foundation that we are laying with capabilities that we expect will expand over time.
Andrew Dudum: Thanks for those insights, Dr. Carroll. As we enter the final months of 2024, I'm so excited by the momentum we are seeing and how all of the pieces we've built over the last seven years are coming together. Our brand continues to connect with customers and is increasingly becoming known as a leader in high-quality personalized solutions. Each of our strategic pillars, a trusted brand, leading technology platform, innovative products and services, and clinical excellence are coalescing in a way that is enabling us to bring increased value to our subscribers at a rapid pace. We see the benefit in this with respect to how our weight loss specialty has rapidly scaled over the course of the last year. I'm impressed with how our team has come together to enable access to weight management solutions and grateful that the company can play an integral part in taking a step toward reducing the half a million preventable deaths of Americans that obesity contributes to each year. While the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, the data we are seeing on our platform suggests widespread difficulty accessing name-brand GLP-1 solutions, and a resolution of the GLP-1 shortage would not be possible without the potential disruption of care to hundreds of thousands of Americans. In the last two months, a total of over 80,000 reports have come through our platform from consumers that have been unable to obtain name-brand GLP-1 treatments. And we are seeing the number of consumers voicing their frustration increase, not decrease in recent weeks. In fact, on a single day last week, we saw nearly 2,000 indications from individuals that have been unable to obtain name-brand GLP-1s. Consumers are doing their part to ensure their voices are heard, and we are actively communicating with federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies to share the experience of our customers and the dynamics that we're seeing across our platform. Our belief is that the principles that have unlocked success in other specialties provide a path for weight loss to continue to succeed when the shortage is ultimately resolved. Having a breadth of solutions that continues to expand enables us to fulfill different consumer requirements and needs while building a specialty that can be increasingly durable. We launched access to a holistic weight-loss program last November for as low as $79 per month, including access to personalized oral-based solutions aimed at addressing the underlying drivers behind an individual's weight gain. Our customers using personalized oral medications as part of the holistic program have reported weight-loss results that are on average at least 70% of the numbers being self-reported by customers utilizing compounded GLP-1s on the platform. The addition of GLP-1s further expanded our weight-loss offering and unlocked access to these potentially life-changing solutions for a broader portion of the American population. Next, we plan to bring liraglutide, the first generic GLP-1 in the market to the platform in 2025. We have already confirmed a core supplier for this addition and over the next few months, expect to finish completing test and batch validation as well as confirming certificates of authenticity. Our technology platform enables us to support consumers in identifying their options and help providers match their patients with the most appropriate solution for an individual's personal clinical need. Consumers' ability to maintain frequent communication with providers as they progress through their treatment with products like GLP-1 can help them effectively balance side-effect concerns with weight-loss goals. We are continuing to actively invest in our 503A facilities, which we expect will enable us to continue offering personalized weight-loss solutions on the platform over the long term. The ability to bring significant value to consumers by democratizing access to high-quality personalized solutions at affordable prices has enabled us to quickly achieve scale. Continued execution on this front provides me with confidence that we can fulfill our ambitious aspiration of having every household in the U.S. using Hims & Hers for their personalized health and wellness needs. With that, I will pass it over to Yemi to walk through our financials and outlook for the remainder of the year in greater detail.
Yemi Okupe: Thanks, Andrew. I will start by providing an overview of our third-quarter financial performance and then discuss our updated outlook for 2024. To date, 2024 has shaped up to be a transformational year with exceptional momentum across several areas of our business. We are excited to see what was already a strong trajectory accelerated in the third quarter. It is becoming increasingly clear that there is tremendous consumer demand for the value that our platform brings as well as for high-quality personalized solutions at accessible prices. In the third quarter, revenue increased 77% year-over-year to $401.6 million with ongoing strength coming out of our online channel. Online revenue was $392.6 million, up 79% from the third quarter of last year. Expansion of our online subscriber base continues to remain the primary driver of growth across the platform. Our subscriber base grew at a record level pace with over 180,000 net subscribers added in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with over two million subscribers, representing a 44% increase from the third quarter of last year. While our GLP-1 offering is resulting in incremental users coming to the platform, the majority of our subscriber growth is coming from our non-GLP-1-related offerings. Our subscriber base, excluding GLP-1s, grew approximately 40% year-over-year. Our continued success at growing our subscriber base can largely be attributed to continued innovation across our portfolio of personalized solutions. We are pleased to achieve our goal of bringing the value of personalized solutions and care to over one million consumers by year end, a quarter early. We are seeing the value to customers of personalized solutions reflected on the platform in two primary ways. The first is through an ability to draw a broader audience of users who may have historically struggled to find treatments that meet their clinical needs. Personalized solutions enable us to reach a broader set of consumer phenotypes that come with different clinical requirements, concerns, and goals. For example, through innovative form factors and dosages, we are able to provide access to differentiated solutions and messaging to the individual that has suffered from hair loss for years relative to the individual earlier on in their journey and more interested in preventative measures. North of 65% of new subscribers benefited from a personalized solution in the third quarter, and we believe this number can continue to grow with continued innovation to meet customers' clinical needs. The second way we are seeing personalization demonstrate value is through higher retention, which we believe reflects increasing consumer satisfaction. User feedback around factors that prevent them from adopting or adhering to a treatment is a core part of the design process for personalized solutions. With greater customization for individual clinical needs at affordable prices, we are seeing retention drift higher across many of our specialties. For example, in some sub-specialties of women's dermatology, we are seeing annual retention increase by more than 20 points year-over-year as the mix of those utilizing a personalized solution increased 40 points year-over-year to approximately 70% of the specialty. We believe that with continued innovation and personalization for individual clinical needs, these benefits will continue to compound across specialties in the future. Monthly online revenue per average subscriber increased 24% in the third quarter relative to last year to $67. A continued shift to more premium personalized offerings has been one contributor towards this dynamic, which has offset headwinds from a migration toward longer duration commitments that carry a lower average monthly price. The success of our weight-loss specialty has been another key driver in the increase in monthly online revenue per average subscriber through two mechanisms. Firstly, our weight-loss solutions carry a higher monthly average price relative to other product offerings. Historically, our offerings have ranged from $35 to $55 per month depending on specialty and duration. Our oral weight management offering starts at $79 per month and our GLP-1 offering generally starts at $199 per month. Secondarily, many of our existing subscribers to other specialties are adopting weight-loss solutions and subscribers that come to the platform initially for weight-loss are subsequently adopting solutions across other specialties. In the third quarter, 20,000 subscribers that acquired a weight-loss solution were pre-existing customers and 20% of weight-loss subscribers had a multi-specialty relationship with Hims & Hers. Increased multi-specialty adoption from our subscribers has been largely organic. In the third quarter, nearly 300,000 subscribers were treated for two or more conditions on the platform, inclusive of subscribers on a single treatment with multi-condition capabilities. As we continue to broaden the variety of solutions across specialties and elevate the number of multi-condition personalized treatments, we expect the number of multi-condition subscribers to continue to increase. In 2025, we expect to elevate the consumer experience for our multi-specialty subscribers through technological advancements on our platform. We believe this carries immense potential to drive higher retention as users receive multiple benefits. Effective execution of our capital allocation framework has enabled us to maintain a robust margin profile while simultaneously accelerating revenue growth. In the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $51.1 million, increasing 4 times relative to last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded more than 7 points year-over-year to nearly 13% as efficiency gains and operating expenses offset an expected degradation in gross margin associated with new product launches. Gross margin declined two points quarter-over-quarter and was 79% in the third quarter. Scaling of the weight-loss specialty was the primary driver of this margin degradation. As we highlighted last quarter, lower margins are a common dynamic we often see early in an offering's lifecycle. As the offering continues to scale and we are able to unlock efficiencies from automation and verticalization, we expect to offset a portion of these gross margin headwinds in the future. Management of our operating cost structure enabled us to offset pressure from gross margin headwinds. G&A costs as a percentage of revenue improved 5 points year-over-year and 2 points quarter-over-quarter to 11%. G&A expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, but in the mid-term, we see continued opportunity for leverage. Operations and support costs as a percentage of revenue improved 2 points year-over-year and 1 point quarter-over-quarter to 12%. We expect continued efficiency gains in these areas over the mid to long term as we benefit from scale efficiencies and further leverage technologies like clever routing to improve the performance of our customer support and care teams. Marketing as a percentage of revenue improved 6 points year-over-year to 45%, marking a new record in our history as a public company for the second quarter in a row. The growing emphasis on personalized solutions, along with the maturation of newer customer groups introduced to favorable pricing models is enhancing our retention rates. Additionally, we are seeing continued success in acquiring customers through more cost-effective channels as awareness of the Hims & Hers brands grows. As we expand in categories where consumers feel more comfortable discussing their experiences, these factors are driving both growth and customer loyalty. Net income was $75.6 million in the third quarter and included a $60.8 million tax benefit related to the release of a tax valuation allowance, partially offset by current period tax expense. Recall, I highlighted this possibility last quarter due to our improving certainty around long-term profitability, resulting in the increased likelihood in the utilization of our deferred tax assets. Our income before taxes was $23.6 million for the third quarter, which excludes the total income tax effects, which were impacted by the valuation allowance release. Excellent execution across the business continues to result in improving cash flow dynamics, putting us in a great position to strategically invest in growth, return capital to shareholders, and further strengthen our balance sheet. Solid free cash flow of $79.4 million in the third quarter enabled us to make strategic investments and increased cash and short-term investments on our balance sheet by nearly $27 million quarter-over-quarter to $254 million. In the third quarter, we saw what we believe to be a meaningful disconnect between the market value and intrinsic value of our stock. As a result, we allocated $30 million to repurchase 1.9 million shares at an average share price of $15.83 during the quarter. At the end of the quarter, there was $70 million remaining on our $100 million share repurchase authorization. Before going into our outlook for the remainder of the year, I'd like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities and give additional insight into how we intend to utilize our balance sheet. Given the momentum we are seeing across the business, we continue to believe our model is positioned to help tens of millions of individuals. As such, our first priority remains in ensuring that our platform has the necessary capabilities in place to meet the growing needs of our subscribers. While CapEx investment has been moderate through the last two quarters, we expect more significant investment during the fourth quarter as we further evolve our capabilities. These investments will primarily go toward two areas of focus. First, increasing our capacity to provide more individuals with access to a personalized solution uniquely designed to address their clinical needs. We expect these investments will position us to continue expanding the variety of form factors, multi-condition treatments, and dosage options available to our customers. Second, increasing the level of automation at each of our affiliated facilities. We expect these investments to drive greater efficiency and allow us to unlock more value for consumers, strengthening our competitive position while allowing an increasingly wider portion of the population to access the solutions available on our platform. We will continue to explore opportunities to expedite the evolution of our platform through strategic M&A transactions. While we set an extremely high bar in this regard, the Medisource acquisition is a great example of our willingness to deploy our balance sheet towards high-value assets that we feel will accelerate our corporate strategy. With that backdrop, I'd like to provide the final update for our 2024 outlook. In the fourth quarter, we are anticipating revenue in the range of $465 million to $470 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 89% to 91%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $50 million to $55 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11% at the midpoint of both ranges. For the full year, we are anticipating revenue of between $1.46 billion to $1.465 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 67% to 68%. Lastly, we expect 2024 adjusted EBITDA will be between $173 million and $178 million. These adjusted EBITDA and revenue ranges imply an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12% at the midpoint of both ranges. Embedded in our outlook is an expectation for more substantial investment in marketing in the fourth quarter relative to prior quarters. A significant portion of this increased spend will be to build general awareness for our brand as well as to educate Americans on the evolving dynamics and solutions in the weight management space. Current momentum of the business provides us with confidence to continue to drive 1 point to 3 points of marketing leverage per annum and achieve our goal of adjusted EBITDA margins of at least 20%, no later than 2030. Continued gross margin degradation is expected in the fourth quarter as our weight loss specialty continues to gain traction. Capital investment will start to reaccelerate as we invest in capabilities that we expect will enable us to fulfill an increasing portion of demand for GLP-1 solutions through our affiliated pharmacies and bring new solutions to the platform in 2025, such as liraglutide. We believe these investments will enable us to bring the benefit of our platform to tens of millions of users across weight loss and our other specialties. Our business has always centered on our subscription platform but now more than ever, the majority of our revenue is derived from recurring subscription revenue. The focus of our strategy is centered around acquiring, retaining, and expanding our relationships with our subscribers. As a result, we will no longer report on orders and average order value after our 2024 10-K filing. Our trajectory in 2024 has been nothing short of phenomenal due to excellent execution across the organization. The business trajectory as well as the current investments in capabilities and talent are setting a robust foundation for 2025. More and more consumers are coming to the platform as we continue to expand technological capabilities and our breadth of solutions. We are drawing world-class providers onto the platform as a result of our technology's ability to help them focus on treating patients versus handling administrative burdens. Exiting the year with over 1 million subscribers on the platform benefiting from personalized solutions and many more consumers benefiting from the potential our platform can bring is a clear signal that our strategy is resonating across America. Our ability to drive these incredible results would not be possible without the ongoing commitment and dedication from every team member at Hims & Hers. I'd like to thank them as well as all of our customers, partners, and shareholders for supporting us in our mission of helping the world feel great through the power of better health. With that, I will now turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Allen Lutz with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Allen Lutz: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I didn't think that I caught it on the prepared remarks, but are you providing what the GLP-1 contribution was in the quarter? Either members or revenue would be fine.
Yemi Okupe: Thanks for the question, Allen. This is Yemi. We provided the year-over-year growth rate of the subscriber base, excluding GLP-1s. So that number was north of 40% year-over-year.
Allen Lutz: Okay, got it. And then Andrew, you mentioned a belief that we can continue to succeed when the [technical difficulty] shortest is ultimately resolved. You mentioned a lot of different opportunities in the shareholder letter, but can you kind of describe to us what do you think the GLP-1 business looks like a year from now? You mentioned different form factors. You mentioned oral business growing, you mentioned liraglutide. How should we think about the way that you're thinking about [technical difficulty] maybe this time next year? Thanks.
Andrew Dudum: Yes. Thanks, Allen. I think like all of our specialty, we're looking at a diverse breadth of the portfolio within the product assortment. And so when you look at the weight loss business, the oral business, which we launched, the fastest business to $100 million run-rate that we had on the platform, that business is delivering 70% of the weight loss of GLP-1 medicines for $70 per month. You then have medications like liraglutide, which are generic medications now coming to the platform in 2025. You have when it comes to - off-brand medications like semaglutide, the ability to hyper personalize for the millions of patients that need to mitigate those side effects of muscle loss and nausea and vomiting, so we think the composition of all of those different avenues will enable quite a durable business across weight and that really, I think, is regardless of whether or not that shortage dynamic happens in a couple of months or next year or years from now. I think the precedent specifically on the GLP-1 side for personalization and compounding to the 503A has existed for many, many years. And I think the regulators, the legislators, the drug companies, the healthcare system really respect the clinical need of that personalization when it's necessary for a patient. And given you're talking about north of 100 million people suffering from obesity in this country, and a very, very high side effect rate with these medications, we fully expect that there's millions of patients that will need that level of personalization that our platform over the long-haul is really well-equipped to deliver on.
Allen Lutz: Great. Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Maria Ripps with Canaccord. Please go ahead.
Maria Ripps: Great. Congrats on the strong quarter and thanks for taking my questions. First, and this is a question for Patrick actually. So you talked about sort of healthy retention rates during the initial period of treatment, especially compared to the Blue Health Intelligence study, what are some key reasons you were sort of observing that are driving some of these patients to maybe drop out during sort of the initial period of treatment, especially given that you were sort of -- that you're able to personalize the titration schedule? And then secondly, more broadly, how are you thinking about the average duration of the GLP-1 patients on the platform?
Andrew Dudum: Yes, Maria, let me take the first question, Pat is not on the call. When it comes to the GLP-1 study and the white paper we put out last week, the numbers were really quite astounded. As you mentioned, 70% of patients on the Hims & Hers platform that are getting this type of personalized treatment are adhering and retaining on the treatment relative to just around 40% in the traditional brick-and-mortar system that has been reported, because that's a 30-point delta in clinical adherence. And when you look at the public data on GLP-1 adherence over the course of a year, the data is also staggeringly low. You're talking about 10% to 15% of people actually being retained. And the reasons for these are relatively straightforward but very material. You have nearly every single person who tries these medications experiencing side effects. You've got very widespread nausea, vomiting, muscle loss is a great concern, the gastrointestinal issues. And for many patients, they can't bear those side-effects. And so I think what's really powerful about the Hims & Hers platform is you've got the combination of factors. You've got the provider communication. As we've mentioned, providers are talking to these patients and engaging with them every single month, allowing a really robust set of communication to titrate, adjust dosing, adjust treatment regimen in order to optimize for the patient's needs and for the side effects you've got technology underpinning this where MedMatch is able to start helping providers set the right prescription treatment from day zero. So, that could be a slower titration schedule in any dose that is optimized for the patient's preferences. And then obviously under the hood, the capabilities on the platform allows for a really wide range of personalized dosages. This has continued to expand in Q3 and I think you'll continue to see us expand that like we have in other specialties. But more and more the nuance of understanding these patients, letting the technology and the provider and then the high-touch allow for personalization is ultimately going to result in better outcomes. And for this treatment specific, given the side-effect rate, I think it's going to be a key driver of much better clinical outcomes in adherence.
Yemi Okupe: And then, Maria, this is Yemi. To take the second part of your question, the factors that Andrew mentioned really are driving stronger retention across the platform. What we are seeing is that the brand, the transparency and really having providers act as a partner in the care with consumers is also providing consumers with greater comfort upfront to commit to longer durations on the platform. And so I think that across the GLP-1 solutions, we are seeing consumers adopt on the higher-end of the duration spectrum that currently sits at a roughly like around five months right now for the typical consumer.
Maria Ripps: Got it. Thank you both and good luck with the rest of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Please go ahead.
Daniel Grosslight: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong quarter. You noted in your shareholder letter that you introduced the personalized dosing and titration for GLP-1s and you mentioned, I think on the call that around 10,000 folks are on that, which would make it a little less than 20% of GLP-1 members, if my math is correct. So I just wanted to confirm that. I heard that correctly around 10,000 on the more personalized titration schedule. And then on that, is it your understanding that these more personalized titrated GLP-1 dosages will be able to-- you'll be able to continue to compound that once the shortages abate, is it enough to kind of get around that personalization carve-out?
Andrew Dudum: Thanks, Daniel. Regarding the 10,000, I think that was specific to a study that we put out on - patient outcomes for GLP-1s, but I don't think it was the exact number of patients, specifically on personalized doses in aggregate. I think more and more, given the nature of our business, as you know for many years across specialties, patients are coming to us for personalization. That's the type of person that comes to us and so I think our platform will continue to invest in catering to those needs. The compounding exemption, whether or not on shortage or not, has always allowed for the personalization when clinically necessary and this can be in form factor, it can be in doses, it can be in combination therapies, there's very well-documented and outlined aspects of the compounding exemption for which are allowed and necessary for clinical flexibility. We believe that dosing specifically for this type of a treatment to mitigate side effects is very much right down the center of what that compound exemption is built for. I think also there's widespread clinical awareness of this level of personalization and the benefits of it, right? When you go back to some of those white papers and the public data around side effects and clinical outcomes and adherence like we were talking about with Maria, these people are really struggling and we see it overwhelmingly on the platform and most just stop, right? They stop taking the medicine for many of these reasons. And so the ability to really customize that level of care, we think is very well-respected precedent, very much within the bounds of the compounding exemption and we also believe it's very well-respected across all the parties in the industry.
Daniel Grosslight: Yes, makes sense. And then on the acquisition of the 503B compound new pharmacy that you recently closed, what investments do you need to make to get that operational and up and running on GLP-1s? And -- I mean, was that a bulk of the CapEx that you were talking about increasing in the fourth quarter?
Yemi Okupe: Yes, thanks for the question, Dan. So I think that when we look at the acquisition of Medisource, I think as it stands today, it does have the capability to produce the GLP-1s. Really the investments that we are looking to make over the course of the next couple quarters is expanding capacity as well as just the overall efficiency through leveraging the playbook of automation. We know that we will have scale with GLP-1s on our platform. And so deploying that knowledge and the playbook that we've utilized across other specialties in the past, something that we expect to do in the coming quarters to drive more-and-more efficiency on that front. With respect to your second question, I think that really the CapEx will be diversified across several areas. We have received clear signal that consumers overwhelmingly are resonating with personalization given the fact that it produces unique advantages to address their clinical needs. And so I think as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we now have over 1 million subscribers that are benefiting from personalized solutions, more than half of the subscriber base. So as a result, we're going to look to also, in addition to verticalizing the GLP-1 operation, start to widen the aperture both from capacity of personalized options that we can have, but also the breadth of personalized options that we can have in the coming quarters. And so I would say that the CapEx really is a mix across those elements.
Daniel Grosslight: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Eric Percher: Thank you. Yemi, I'd like to follow on that line and just ask, I heard 503A investment for the long-term, 503B in the near-term. How do you think about the ability to flex on those two as the regulatory environment changes? And is there any major difference in efficiency if you need to move toward 503A?
Yemi Okupe: Yes. Thanks for the question, Eric. I think that really we're going to need to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. So, we have a very talented team across the board. We also have the strength of our balance sheet with north of $250 million and growing free cash flow portfolio that will enable us to invest in these things concurrently. So we would expect to continue to invest in the capabilities in both the 503A as well as the 503B. With respect to the efficiency across the two different operations. 503Bs are generally more efficient than 503As. Given the fact that we had 503As for numerous years, we do believe that we can drive a substantial amount of efficiency. The reality is that both operations will be significantly more efficient than utilizing a third party. So, we see substantial opportunity for efficiency and greater economics within that subspecialty in the coming quarters.
Eric Percher: And the liraglutide, is that identification of API versus a manufacturer of a generic injectable? And does that then have to go into an NDA submission?
Andrew Dudum: Hi, Eric, great question. Similar across all of the medications that we offer on the platform, there's a pretty extensive set of protocols that the supply chain goes through, and many of the times this is DMS numbers with the FDA, batch authentication, certificates of authentication that we open source to all of the patients. We do in-house and third-party independent testing of these APIs and treatments, both what is absolutely clinically necessary from a safety standpoint with the FDA, but also kind of the above and beyond that our team goes through just to get comfortable. So when it comes to liraglutide, it will be the exact same process that we've utilized across the stack, and we're really excited about that medication in particular, just because I think patients are really looking for value when it comes to obesity treatments, and that medication is known, it's increasingly available, the affordability profile will be something that we think is achievable for many, and similar to our oral medications where you're seeing 70% of the weight loss for $70 per month, that type of value offering is really something we're pretty excited to bring to market. But same protocols and same safety standards when it comes to bringing that to customers and how we think about it.
Eric Percher: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald with Needham. Please go ahead.
Ryan MacDonald: Hi, congrats on a great quarter and thanks for taking my questions. Maybe to start out, it seems like the oral business and weight loss continues to perform really well despite sort of the now availability of GLP-1s on your platform. Can you just talk about how you're sort of able to sort of effectively route patients or customers to the oral option versus some of the GLP-1s? And what's really the top of the funnel driving demand? Is it customers coming in looking for GLP-1s and sort of being made aware and educated on the oral option? Just any color there would be helpful. Thanks.
Andrew Dudum: Thanks, Ryan. It's a great question. In many ways, I think we see ourselves as a platform looking a little bit like Switzerland, where we offer a wide range of treatments and services and try to help patients identify what is right for them. That could be related to clinical needs, it could be related to personal preferences, something they've heard of or something they're excited by, so there's really no, so to speak, Trojan Horse where we're leveraging one medication to bring people in. The oral treatment option as we've shared is an incredibly robust business within the obesity business, as we shared, last quarter is the fastest specialty we have ever launched on the platform, just the oral medication alone, and what that is doing something really special. It's doing something that also is very rarely accessible to the mass market, which is a hyper-personalization approach to understand the underlying factors driving your weight gain. So, this could be insulin resistance, metabolic disorder, binge eating, depressive dynamics, and symptoms. And our SVP of Weight Management, Dr. Craig Primack has been a specialist in this for 20 years and we've brought a lot of that expertise that is available only to the 1% or 2% to the masses at scale for the price point that's very, very achievable. So I think different people have different preferences and different clinical needs. This is a treatment that is, as I was saying, delivering 70% of the weight loss of an injectable weekly gold standard GLP-1 for only $70 per month. So incredible value, which I think just naturally is attracting consumers. I think there's also a lot of comfort in the fact that these treatments in the oral business have been around for decades. The known side-effects and safety profiles are very widely studied and the fact that there's different formats oral medication, chews, versus an injectable is also I think appealing to people. So we expect that oral business to be a large composition of the weight business regardless of GLP-1s and liraglutide and everything to come.
Ryan MacDonald: Appreciate all the co there, Andrew. Maybe as a follow-up, you mentioned obviously a number of options of how the weight business is going to continue to evolve in the future. One obviously being, as supply becomes available offering the branded options. As we think about the incremental investments you're making, is there any sort of contemplation in the near term about sort of building out the infrastructure for sort of getting reimbursed and taking insurance or would you expect even as you start to offer the branded options continuing on the cash base side? Thanks.
Andrew Dudum: Yes, great question, Ryan. I think right now, the simplicity of the cash-pay side has been relatively straightforward for patients. As most know, the actual coverage for these branded medications when it comes to obesity is very, very low. Almost nobody without extremely high-end plans are getting coverage and you see more and more coverage drop in quarter-over-quarter even in the last couple of weeks. So the simplicity, I think of the cash-pay market is probably our approach. We will continue to try to bring more branded options to the platform because again choice is king and consumers do love that choice. But with that said, I think we're excited by some of the treatments like liraglutide and the oral treatments and the personalized semaglutides and GLP-1s that offer really effective treatment at something that is more accessible to the mass market. And as we shared in the prepared remarks, we're now treating hundreds of thousands of Americans that are in the zip codes and economic brackets that really, really struggled with care. And so I think it's increasingly becoming a really spirited altruistic part of the business that we're really excited about.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler with Seaport Research. Please go ahead.
Aaron Kessler: Great. Thanks, guys. A couple of questions. Just in terms of new sub-verticals with kind of Dr. Shepard joining as CMO of Hers, can you just help us think through the potential kind of for new sub-verticals within the Hers category? And just within some of the maybe the traditional categories you've been and including sexual health, kind of hair, dermatology, just provide us an update on maybe performance of some of those within the quarter as well? Thank you.
Andrew Dudum: Yes. Thanks, Aaron. So on the new side of the house, we're really excited by Dr. Shepherd joining. The Hers business, as we mentioned, is the fastest part of the aggregate business growing, right? It's an incredible business and it's diversified quite dramatically across mental health, dermatology as you shared, metabolic health, obesity. So an incredible amount of diversity taking place that's actually driving that. I think the combination of moves that we've made such as bringing Dr. Shepherd onto the team as well as the 503-B Medisource in California, which allows for sterile injectables, kind of leads towards categories that we've spoken about in the past that Dr. Shepherd is an expert on and these are categories such as perimenopause, menopause, hormonal therapy and all of the related impacts that might have for women as they age. Same thing on the men's side of the business. We expect that business to be something that is rolling out in the next couple of years and something that our customers really have been wanting for some time. So, that's maybe a little bit of color on kind of the new verticals to come. With regard to the core, as Yemi shared, there was 40-plus percent year-over-year growth in our subscribers excluding the GLP-1 business. So, the core is growing very robustly. You're seeing mass-market adoption of the personalization options across all of these categories with, I think it's 65%, 70% of new customers now opting for personalization, which is really bringing a level of clinical excellence, adherence, stickiness, retention, and customer demand to kind of all-time highs across the core, which we think has been an exciting contributor, which is even more exciting when you add in obviously the scale of the obesity opportunity. So it's a combination of those factors that are driving all of this growth.
Aaron Kessler: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jonna Kim with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Jonna Kim: Thank you for taking my question. As you focus on creating more efficiency around your platform, how are you thinking about the pricing structure overall? And do you plan to lower any price in 2025? And also as you think about the weight loss side, will you be able to lower your pricing on that specialty as well?
Yemi Okupe: Yes, Jonna. Thanks so much for the question. I think what we constantly do as we unlock efficiency gains is we look for the best vehicles to pass that through to consumers. Some of this you are seeing in the rollout of some of the newer products like the multi-condition treatments in sex and hair where we were able to roll that out for as low as $49 per month for both conditions. I think that as we unlock additional efficiencies, we will definitely test price as a lever. But as we see the technological capabilities across the platform expand and we also have numerous specialties, we're very excited by some of the additional creative opportunities that we can do beyond price to pass value back to consumers.
Jonna Kim: Got it. And just one follow-up, you mentioned GLP-1 users are also using other offerings that you have, what is the strategy to further grow that sort of the cross-selling of your platform? Thank you so much.
Yemi Okupe: To date, it's largely been organic like what we do see is that as we have a wide breadth of specialties across the platform, users are organically opting into multiple treatments. As we look to 2025, I think that subscriber growth will largely be the continued focus in aggregate. But what we can do is make it easier for users to opt and select into multiple bundles through moving friction points that we're aware of today, and so we would expect that number over time to go up, but largely in the next quarter or two will be mainly organic.
Jonna Kim: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jailendra Singh with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Jailendra Singh: Thank you and congrats on a strong quarter. I want to go back to GLP-1-related contribution in the quarter. It seems like GLP-1-related subscriber count was around 47,000 to 48,000 in the quarter, is there any additional color you can provide as to frame the revenue contribution in the quarter? You said 12 million in 2Q, just trying to understand the growth there. Basically, the AOV was up pretty strong sequentially and trying to understand how much is driven by GLP-1 contribution versus like other tailwinds in the quarter.
Yemi Okupe: Yes. I think I can kind of take that in a few -- answer your questions. So I think that we largely see the subscriber growth coming from the core. That said, we do see accelerating GLP-1 growth, some of that was a result of the fact that we started to roll-out GLP-1s across a broader number of states. Additionally, as consumers become more aware of the capabilities that we offer and we expand those capabilities, we do see GLP-1 adoption accelerating and increasing on the platform. I think just kind of doing the math on the subscriber count and looking at the rough average approximation of the monthly average revenue per subscriber can get you within the ballpark of what the GLP-1 contribution looks like.
Jailendra Singh: Okay. And then going back to the comment earlier made about only 13% of GLP-1 canceled their treatment in the first month. Of the remaining 87%, are you seeing customers renewing for the same duration? Are you seeing them opting for higher duration of subscription? Are you seeing like people getting comfortable signing for 3, 6, 12 months? Just trying to understand the mix of the duration in the subscription here.
Yemi Okupe: Yes. I think what we do see is really, I think that the hurdle like most of our other specialties, the cancellations come early on in the life-cycle of a given user. As a user, particularly for medication like GLP-1s starts to cross the 12-week or three-month milestone, you generally do see that the overall platform become sticky and we would expect that. With respect to the duration of wait, what we mentioned in a question earlier is that we're seeing a duration kind of in the ballpark of five months. And that really is just a testament to consumers are enjoying the transparency that our platform is bringing, they're enjoying -- having providers act as partners and walk them through what -- how to get effective care, how to manage side-effects that Andrew mentioned earlier, such as muscle loss or nausea. Providers walking consumers through that is really resulting in strong and sound results. And as a result, we're seeing a very strong performance on the typical durations that consumers are signing up for.
Jailendra Singh: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And that's all the time we had for questions today. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",split transcript is available for premium subscribers only.,HIMS

And with that, I will turn the call over to Andrew.
Andrew Dudum: Thanks, Bill. What an incredible last few months we have had to finish a breakout year. At Hims & Hers, we believe we are building the next-generation health care platform, a platform that leverages personalization and technology unlike any traditional health care system, delivering access to affordable, on-demand, high quality, and precision tailored care to millions of people. The future model of health and wellness that centers around the consumer and the consumer alone. This vision requires extraordinary levels of innovation across technology, infrastructure, and services. And I'm absolutely in awe at the team's execution across so many avenues to accelerate toward this vision. From our recent acquisition of our new whole body lab testing facilities, which will bring Hims & Hers customers a deeper understanding of the comprehensive health and treatment personalization, to our acquisition of our new Menlo Park peptide facility, which will establish domestic durability of our supply chain for one of the most innovative and exciting areas in medicine, to our Super Bowl ad, which sparked an incredible breadth of discussion around our existing health care system, and lastly, to our growing bench of impressive talent, making our team an even stronger competitive advantage. We are attracting leaders across disciplines from technology to women's health who recognize the extraordinary opportunity to reshape American health care. At the end of 2024, over 2 million subscribers entrusted Hims & Hers to aid them in their journey to better health with thousands more joining daily. This vision of an on-demand personalized health care platform is resonating with consumers across America. Over the past 25 years, Uber and Airbnb reshaped transportation and hospitality. Amazon and Shopify revolutionized ecommerce and logistics. Netflix and Spotify redefined media consumption, and PayPal and Square modernized digital payments. Yet we haven't seen a similarly transformative shift in one of life's most critical areas, health care. Recently, however, I felt the same sense of disruption and possibility with what we are building at Hims & Hers. These disruptors introduced a concept of on-demand in a manner I had never experienced, hyper personalized and catered to my needs, transparent in their pricing, and ultimately reliable and empowering. These are words never uttered when describing health care in America. At Hims & Hers, our ambition is simple. We plan to change that. We have been breaking the status quo since our founding in 2017. And through our vision of what health care can and should look like, we've achieved a breadth of accomplishments that few thought possible. We've engineered a vertically integrated proprietary technology stack that powers over 10,000 patient visits per day and we believe is home to one of the most powerful, completely closed loop datasets in health care. We've built nearly half a million square feet of cutting-edge pharmacies and fulfillment centers that deliver personalized treatments across dozens of conditions and multiple innovative form factors, helping support high quality clinical outcomes through optimized dosing, side effects mitigation, and vitamin supplementation. And we've broadened our brand from one that's focused on niche men's categories like ED to one that millions of Americans entrust for their health and wellness needs across an ever broadening set of specialties from men's and women's health, dermatology, mental health, adjunctive cardiovascular support, and most recently, metabolic health. We are in the earliest of days in transforming how Americans improve their health and wellness. And when we think about the future, our investment areas fit into simple yet powerful buckets. First, by leveraging advancements in technology, specifically AI, we can expand the scope, quality, and capabilities of diagnostic tools available on Hims & Hers platform. Second, as our technology gets more sophisticated and we bring more data rich integrations onto our ecosystem like lab testing and wearable devices, we can expand the breadth of personalized treatment, including preventative capabilities accessible on our platform. Third, by focusing on the long-term consumer journey, we can expand the value of the Hims & Hers relationship with improved offerings that drive increased and higher engagement follow-up care. And fourth, as our verticalized capabilities and platform gets stronger, we see a path to export our capabilities beyond the walls of Hims & Hers, helping legacy health care enterprises transform to be capable of delivering the same quality, efficiency and personalization for their patients. Our recent investments are in lockstep with this future vision, helping to position us to execute across each of these critical areas. Data is a key differentiator on our platform as we are one of, if not the only, large scale vertically integrated health systems spanning the end-to-end patient journey. At the end of 2024, we began negotiations to acquire a provider of at-home whole body lab testing, which we were excited to close last week. With this additional capability, we will be able to test for a wide range of critical biomarkers across heart, hormone, liver, thyroid and prostate helping to proactively identify individual risks for disease. We believe this type of comprehensive health testing should be available to everyone given the possible life altering learnings. Given this, we look forward to expanding the value each Hims & Hers subscriber receives this year with comprehensive testing at extraordinarily affordable cost to our customers. Whole body testing gives providers even more insights into their patients' health, enabling a more holistic individualized treatment plan inclusive of personalized medication, supplements, workout routines and nutrition. Whole body lab testing will also enable us to expand into specialties such as menopausal support, low testosterone, and more. With this acquisition, we are elevating the personalization of care individuals will be able to access on our platform. Expanding datasets enable us to identify elements of a member's health such as vitamin deficiencies and unoptimized health indicators leading to better personalization of treatment through expanded offerings that take these diagnostic components into account. As we deepen the personalized care, we can offer investments across our nearly half a million square footprint across Ohio, Arizona, and California will set the foundation to potentially move from offering hundreds of personalized treatment variations to eventually offering thousands of treatments over the coming years. At the end of 2024, we also signed an agreement to acquire a California peptide facility. As we work to address chronic conditions and areas of need among Americans, this facility will provide the ability to explore innovative advances in preventative health, metabolic optimization, cognitive performance, recovery science, and biological resistances. I'm thrilled with the potential range of treatments and peptide science and we are committed to being at the forefront. We believe that this acquisition will provide us with opportunities to more closely participate in this innovation and also bolster our domestic supply chain for treatments that could be critical to America's future. As the breadth of treatments and services expand in our platform over the course of the next decade, our belief is that advancements in technology can facilitate materially better outcomes and unlock a level of access unlike anything available today. We believe that AI and scaled de-identified data will help power extremely important network effects for our platform, enabling each new customer's experience to drive improvement to the care and experience of the next. We also believe that leveraging AI and our current clinical expertise and intelligence can elevate the types of follow-up care available for millions of individuals. We see great health care as a combination of appropriate treatment, high frequency provider support, and access to services that help individuals achieve healthier habits. In 2024, we launched tools such as BMI calculators and trackers to help members monitor water intake, nutrition, movement, and sleep. All focused on helping our subscribers build a healthier lifestyle. In this next-generation of health care, we see a world where AI can substantially elevate the subscriber experience by providing resources with greater sophistication such as AI coaches, therapists, nutritionists, and trainers available for 24/7 on-demand support to help our customers make meaningful lifestyle changes in pursuit of their health and wellness goals. Trusted and empathetic AI powered care coordinators to help customers navigate their health care journey and greater transparency and visibility into the reasoning that drives each treatment and service recommendation on our platform in a manner not constrained by the availability of provider time on the platform. While our ambitions and technology advancement are far reaching, we have been energized by the market receptivity to this vision. Leading engineering executives, world class AI researchers, and operators responsible for building and massively scaling some of the most notable businesses in the world have been part of our year long search for our Chief Technology Officer. We have been humbled by the shared excitement for our vision and the widespread passion to transform the American healthcare system. We are thrilled to share that we have signed an offer for our new Chief Technology Officer, and we expect to share more about our latest executive team member in the coming weeks. Our focus in 2025 will be on continuing to further progress our platform capabilities, deepening our competitive moat, and expanding our value to customers. We will do this through continued execution across five key priorities. First, through the integration of whole body lab testing, we will provide access to richer insights for consumers into their health. I cannot stress the transformative unlocks we believe will come from empowering customers with their data. Diagnostic capabilities will serve consumers by supporting our expansion into additional specialties such as menopause and low testosterone and pave the way for a greater breadth of personalized offerings inclusive of medications, supplements, and lifestyle changes. Second, we'll continue to invest in our pharmacies and infrastructure. These investments will come in the form of expanding our capacity for sterile compounding as well as further automation of facilities to unlock the capacity to offer access to thousands of more highly personalized treatments in the future. Third, we'll broaden and deepen the capabilities of our technology stack to facilitate even better recommendations from providers to each individual patient as well as lay the foundation for AI centric tools and coaches capable of even further improving the quality of follow-up care received on the platform. And fourth, we expect to conduct R&D for the launch of future specialties and subspecialties that leverage our capabilities and reach an even broader set of customers. And finally, we'll continue to position ourselves to be a leader in addressing the chronic obesity epidemic across America. There may not be a more impactful use case for precision medicine than America's obesity epidemic, which impacts 100 million individuals across the country and results in 0.5 million preventable deaths per annum. North of 200,000 individuals joining the Hims & Hers platform in the span of a year to meet their weight loss needs is evidence of the benefits that consumers see in our approach to personalized medicine. As we shared last year, we believe our approach can enable material improvements in clinical adherence and compelling customer satisfaction and we're seeing gains in the realization of this goal. In order to truly address the epidemic, patients need comprehensive care that extends beyond medicine to making lifestyle changes from nutrition to exercise to mental health and we are dedicated to this approach. Precision medicine is about using the right tools for the right patient at the right time. We believe this approach to personalized medicine will ultimately drive better clinical outcomes by enabling providers to personalize the dose, form factor, and other clinical delivery aspects of existing clinically validated medications. In our work, we are committed to integrity and transparency. We are not bypassing the regulatory process nor are we creating new drugs. The regulatory framework for compounding and the FDA have long recognized the need for compounders to be able to compound medication to meet patient needs that utilize ingredients of, but that are not essential copies of existing drugs. We focus on providing access to better care in this framework through personalization period. We believe that Americans deserve transparency about the system and their options and we will continue to passionately push back against any attempts to confuse or scare consumers about whether compounding can be done legally and safely. We won't claim improved efficacy until the data substantiates it. We will continue to show our quality and safety process across every step of the customer journey. We take a logical approach that lets patients and providers draw their own conclusions because we believe that patients, not pharmaceutical profits, should drive our health care system. We are aware that change can be scary for industry incumbents. Big pharma's reaction to our call to fix today's stuck and sick health care system has been to band together and question the need for affordable compounded solutions and incite fear in regular Americans through broad strokes statements about the safety of all compounded medications. As always, we'll continue to monitor and comply with regulatory requirements related to the GLP-1 shortages. And we will continue to primarily focus within our weight loss category on bringing care to individuals that stand to benefit from our oral-based offerings, liraglutide later this year, and clinically necessary personalized dosages of semaglutide. The investments we've made on our platform will help ensure that we can effectively help the millions of potential Americans that can benefit from our holistic approach to weight loss treatment. Additionally, these investments position us to be a leader in providing access to high quality treatment to millions of more Americans as more brand name GLP-1 medications go generic in the coming years. As a founder-led company, we have one rare advantage that most companies do not, extreme patients. While most might get lost in the noise of today's realities, the future is where we are focused. A future where high quality personalized care is available to everyone on-demand at affordable prices from the comfort of their home. This vision is coming to reality and it's shaking the incumbent system. We believe that in the coming years, that future will be obvious and available to all. We look forward to updating you on our progress across these priorities over the course of 2025. With that, I will pass it over to Yemi to talk through our financial performance and outlook for 2025.
Yemi Okupe: Thanks, Andrew. I will start by providing an overview of our fourth quarter financial performance before diving further into our outlook for 2025. The success of our platform in 2024 is a reflection of how our ability to democratize access to high quality personalized treatments and services is resonating with consumers. Revenue was $481 million and $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter and 2024 fiscal year respectively. This represents year-over-year revenue growth of 95% for the fourth quarter and 69% for 2024. Helping drive our success is our ability to attract and retain subscribers across our tenured specialties and secondarily, an ability to scale new offerings such as our weight loss treatments. Revenue outside of our GLP-1 offering increased 43% year-over-year to $1.2 billion in 2024, reflecting an ability to achieve the floor of our revenue expectations for 2025 a year early. Expansion of personalized treatments on our platform is continuing to result in strong subscriber growth. Total subscribers on the platform increased 45% to over 2.2 million in the fourth quarter with over 55% of those subscribers subscribing to at least one personalized solution. Unique form factors, multi-condition treatments and personalized dosages are unlocking growth in some of our most tenured specialties and serving as an accelerant for some of our newer specialties. For example, in the fourth quarter, subscribers in men's and women's dermatology grew over 55% and 100% year-over-year respectively. Our belief is that lab diagnostics will unlock a greater breadth of personalized treatments, which will further expand the runway for growth across our existing specialties. Almost 100 million Americans are currently struggling with weight loss. We launched an oral based weight loss offering in the fourth quarter of 2023, which saw great success as it scaled to a revenue run rate of over 100 million in just over seven months. Our GLP-1 offering, which launched in the second quarter of 2024, has experienced similar success, delivering north of $225 million of incremental revenue in 2024. We believe success behind this offering is a result of the brand equity we have built over the years as well as our high touch model that includes frequent provider engagement, tools to build healthier lifestyle habits, and access to personalized treatments. Line of sight to future operational efficiencies gave us comfort to make our injectable offering even more affordable. We reduced the price for our 12 month SKU from $199 a month to $165 per month in December. The majority of weight loss subscribers are now opting for treatment plans of six months or more, which we believe will translate into strong retention and improved adherence for our weight loss subscribers. Similar to previous strategic pricing actions, we are confident that these changes will be long-term accretive to the platform and provide a path to unlock economies of scale in the future. Additionally, we believe that the ability of providers on our platform to personalize successful titration plans and steady state dosages strengthens with each subscriber that has success in our platform, making our ability to rapidly scale a distinct competitive advantage. While the addition of subscribers remains the primary component of our growth, monthly online average revenue per subscriber is becoming a more meaningful contributor as well. Monthly online average revenue per subscriber increased 38% year-over-year to $73 in the fourth quarter. Scaling of GLP-1s as well as subscribers shifting to more premium personalized offerings are the primary growth drivers. Significant investment was made in the fourth quarter in areas that we believe set the foundation to drive future economies of scale. Despite this investment, adjusted EBITDA margins remained strong at over 11% as adjusted EBITDA increased over 160% year-over-year to $54 million in the fourth quarter. For the fiscal year of 2024, our platform delivered $177 million of adjusted EBITDA as adjusted EBITDA margins more than doubled year-over-year to 12%. Gross margins declined approximately two points quarter-over-quarter in line with expectations highlighted earlier this year. The scaling of our GLP-1 offering as well as strategic pricing actions enacted within our GLP-1 offering in the fourth quarter are the primary drivers of this change. We expect margins to start to recover in the second quarter as we reach milestones for pre-adjusted volume driven discounts across our operation, with further opportunity as we expand sterile fulfillment capabilities within our affiliated facilities later this year. In the fourth quarter, we lean into specialty specific marketing on national stages at scale for the first time. Marketing as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter was 46%, representing a five point improvement from the prior year and a one point degradation from the prior quarter. Higher retention as a result of an increasing shift toward personalization as well as acquisition of customers organically and through lower cost channels continues to provide confidence in our ability to achieve between one to three points of leverage on our marketing spend per annum. For the fiscal year of 2024, we exceeded this goal, driving marketing as a percentage of revenue down to 46%, reflecting over five points of leverage relative to the prior year. Strict management of our operating costs continues to allow us to gain leverage on our G&A as well as operations and support costs. In the fourth quarter, G&A and operations and support costs as a percentage of revenue improved three points and one point year-over-year respectively. Net income was $26 million in the fourth quarter and $126 million for the full year, marking our first full year of GAAP profitability. The full year figure included a tax benefit primarily related to the release of a domestic tax valuation allowance, partially offset by current period tax expense. Cash flow generation remains strong as we delivered nearly $60 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, bringing the total free cash flow generated in 2024 to nearly $200 million. Cash and short-term investments on our balance sheet were over $300 million at the end of the year. 2024 was an exceptional year for Hims & Hers, but as Andrew mentioned, we believe that we are just scratching the surface of what our platform can deliver in the years to come. Before going into our outlook for the year, I will provide insight into how we expect to allocate capital in 2025. We expect more capital investment across a few key areas in 2025 to continue building toward our long-term vision for the company. These areas include, first, an investment and expansion of sterile capabilities and capacity within our 503A and 503B facilities. These investments will ultimately enable us to more economically provide offerings such as liraglutide on our platform, which we believe will further enhance the durability of our weight loss offering. Additionally, sterile capabilities provide a critical component necessary to expand into other areas such as menopausal support and low testosterone in the future. Second, we are investing to expand capacity for a greater breadth of personalized offerings through investment in equipment with increased automation capabilities as well as the launch of a larger facility in Arizona later this year. Our ambition Our ambition is to have the capacity to leverage additional de-identified data points from interactions on our platform and lab diagnostics to increase the depth of personalized treatments available to subscribers, whether that be through additional form factors or multi-condition treatments. Third, we expect to integrate lab diagnostic capabilities into our platform in a way that allows us to offer it to subscribers at a low cost or in some instances for free. We believe lab diagnostics can be an additional value add service for subscribers that serve as a foundation for more personalized treatments as well as enable expansion in other specialties in the future. Lastly, we will continue our focus on strengthening the long-term durability of our domestic supply chain through investment in our recently acquired peptide facility. We view this facility and peptide capabilities as providing an additional long-term anchor for our focus on US based operations as well as an opportunity to explore innovations in medicine made possible through peptide development in the coming years. Similar to prior years, we will be thoughtful in our allocation of capital across these initiatives and expect to continue to deliver strong free cash flow in the future. With that backdrop, I will provide an additional perspective into our outlook for 2025. In the first quarter, we are anticipating revenue in the range of $520 million to $540 million representing a year-over-year increase of 87% to 94%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $55 million to $65 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11% at the midpoint of both ranges. For the full year, we are anticipating revenue of between $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion representing a year-over-year increase of 56% to 63%. It is our expectation that 2025 adjusted EBITDA will be between $270 million and $320 million. These adjusted EBITDA and revenue ranges imply an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13% at the midpoint of both ranges. Embedded within our outlook are the following assumptions. First, given what we know today, we anticipate 2025 revenue contributions from our weight loss specialty of at least $725 million. This figure excludes contributions from commercially available dosages of semiglutide, which will not be offered on the platform after the first quarter. There may be the potential to offer commercially available dosages of compounded semiglutide throughout the year. However, we see our steady state weight loss offering being primarily composed of our evolving oral based solutions as well as liraglutide later this year. Personalized semiglutide dosages will supplement these core offerings for the subset of consumers for whom it is a clinical necessity. Supply chain consistency across 2025 inclusive of affiliated pharmacy and third-party fulfillment and distribution dynamics is a key assumption in our guidance. Second, our expectation is that the first quarter will remain an investment quarter as a result of the strategic pricing actions made in December and investment in our one minute Super Bowl campaign. We expect some pressure on gross and adjusted EBITDA margins in the first quarter, but anticipate improvement through 2025 beginning in the second quarter. Line of sight exists to realize volume driven discounts across our ecosystem later in the second quarter and further benefit is expected as greater sterile fulfillment capacity from our facilities comes online throughout the year. Third, we remain committed to ensuring that our voice is heard during the most culturally relevant moments across America and expect to continue to have a significant voice for the most pertinent issues across healthcare relevant to our platform. Our expectation is that we will maintain a one year payback period on our investments while executing these activities. Additionally, we have high confidence in our ability to continue driving between one to three points of marketing leverage per annum as a result of, first, an increasing amount of our spend becoming semi fixed in nature. Second, an ability to draw a broader audience and retain them as a result of high quality personalized solutions available on the platform. Third, an increasing amount of customers acquired organically and through lower cost channels as a result of historical investments in our brand as well as entry into specialties more conducive to word-of-mouth referrals and lastly, the continued inventration of additional subscriber cohorts on our platform. Marketing leverage is an instrumental component of our path toward margins of at least 20% by 2030, which we believe we are on track to achieve. Lastly, we expect long-term revenue retention to remain above 85% as subscribers engage with personalized products across more specialties. Ongoing subscriber adoption of personalized solutions present both acquisition and retention benefits across each of our specialties. Recent trends give us confidence that each of our specialties will deliver more than $100 million of revenue in 2025. Capabilities that were built organically as well as recently acquired provide a pathway and exciting future for Hims & Hers in 2025 and beyond. Investments that we make in 2025 will position us to transform the way millions of individuals optimize their health through the examples that Andrew highlighted for our long-term vision. Our ability to drive these strong results would not be possible without the dedication of over 1,000 employees across Hims & Hers. I'd like to thank them as well as all of our customers and partners that support us in our mission of helping the world feel great through the power of better health. We appreciate the support of our subscribers and shareholders and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Bill to kick off Q&A with two questions from our retail community.
Bill Newby: Thanks, Yemi, and thank you to all the investors who've sent us questions over the weekend. It's clear that, that part of the investor base continues to expand, and we're excited to more regularly engage with this part of the group.
A - Bill Newby: To get things started, this was a top question from the Hims House, a retail community dedicated to Hims that is growing in popularity. The question is, what are the top three to four strategies that will allow Hims to reach tens of millions of subscribers on this platform? And what is the rough time frame for reaching this goal?
Andrew Dudum: Thanks, Bill, and thanks, Hims House. It's been fun to watch you guys grow as a community. I think 10 million subs on the platform to me feels really quite in reach. And I think, frankly, pretty straightforward from a growth standpoint if you look at historical growth over the last five to six years. My optimistic hope and personally ambition would be to try to achieve this in the next five to six years. I think the top strategies are the ones, frankly, that the business is operating against today, which is, first, to expand the categories and the specialties on the platform, so you'll see deeper segmentation, more indications. I think the lab testing acquisition this past week is something that will massively accelerate the breadth of conditions. The second, I think, is a broad expansion of the personalized treatments on the platform. And as we talked about in the prepared remarks, my ambition is really to go from a place where we have 300 personalized treatments which exist today on the platform to a place in the not-so-distant future, where you've got thousands of treatment variations. And this is hyper-personalization across dosing, side effect mitigation, multi-condition support, vitamin supplementation, and ultimately, form factor, which we know has a massive adherence contribution. So I think as you expand those personalized treatments, you're unlocking different groups of people who feel like there's something on the platform that better represents their needs. And then I think lastly, there's going to be a real accelerated investment in technology that's going to be necessary to empower this type of scale. Right now, as I shared, we're powering north of 10,000 visits on the platform per day. You need to be able to power 20,000 and 30,000 and 40,000 visits on the platform per day. And so there's a real necessary investment across decision-making tools for providers to help them be more efficient and more precise, more long-term capabilities with AI that allow a customer to have a higher touch experience after they've been treated and more handheld throughout the long-term of their journey. And so all of that, I think, is kind of the big area. So very excited from a technology standpoint to have our CTO joining and be able to share more about that offer in the next couple of weeks.
Bill Newby: Thanks, Andrew. Kind of on that last point, we've received a lot of questions on AI and its applications on the platform. This one comes from Stephen W, who asks, how is Hims leveraging AI and data analytics to enhance the telehealth offerings today as well as the personalized treatments and drive increased efficiency in the health care ecosystem? Are there plans for AI-driven diagnostics or automation to improve patient outcomes?
Andrew Dudum: Yes. Thanks, Stephen, for the question. Absolutely, across both of those, both diagnostics and long-term patient outcome management. I think increasingly, AI is at the core of everything that we're discussing as a management team. What we are building, I believe, is possibly the most powerful data set in health care because it's really the only at-scale fully verticalized end-to-end system. So we are overseeing and managing not only the initial patient intake, but the diagnostic component, the treatment component, the long-term relationship, the chronic care, the adjustment to treatment and ultimately, whether or not the outcome is delivered. And so that data set delivers a really powerful flywheel. I think what you'll see from a diagnostic standpoint is real investments in MedMatch, the ability to more precisely identify diagnosis for patients but also personalized treatments for patients. I think you'll obviously see lab work be built into MedMatch in a way that expands the range of diagnostic capabilities and treatment capabilities. And then lastly, I think, on that follow-up care side and on the patient improvement side, I think, you'll see us meaningfully change the status quo for what it looks like to be a Hims & Hers customer long-term. One of the things that I think about a lot as an entrepreneur is what are things that the ultra-rich have access to? And then how can we broaden that and give that to everybody? So things that people have are on-demand therapists, right? They've got nutritionalists. They have fitness coaches. They have meditation coaches. These are people that are in your life, helping you to live healthier lifestyle. I think we are capable of building incredible AI versions of all of those coaches, which really changed the paradigm for how easy it is to change the lifestyle dynamics in your house and ultimately expand that to tens of millions of more people down the line. Now at the end of all of this, I think what is maybe even the most exciting from an AI standpoint is as we build these fairly proprietary models internally and validate them internally across our data set, I think, there's one day the opportunity to open this up and in partnership actually help power the existing legacy health care systems and help transform those legacy health care systems to actually be able to deliver the Hims & Hers' quality and experience and personalization at scale. And I think that ambition is really exciting for us because it means that we're not only changing health care for the customers that are coming to Hims & Hers, but we're also one day possibly helping power the rest of the system in delivering great health care to others.
Bill Newby: Great. Thanks, Andrew. Thanks again to all of us who sent in questions. We look forward to hearing from you again next quarter. And with that, I'll pass it back to the operator and we can begin the regular way Q&A.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Maria Ripps of Canaccord. Please go ahead.
Maria Ripps: Great. Congrats on strong results and thanks so much for taking my questions. First, I just like to talk about GLP-1 personalization. Can you maybe just help us understand some of the mechanics around assessing new patients when deciding if they're good candidates for personalized semaglutide dosing? I guess especially for some of the patients that are new to GLP-1s and maybe haven't had experience with side effects. I guess what's your approach to understanding if someone needs a personalized solution versus some patients that have been attracted to more affordable prices?
Andrew Dudum: Hey, Maria, that's a great question. I think first off, we see a lot of patients that come onto the platform that have already experienced GLP-1. And I think there's no shortage of data to support this. I think a huge portion of the population has started, tried, and unfortunately turned off of them and that data is quite public. A lot of it, as we've talked about, muscle loss concerns, extreme nausea, extreme vomiting. So what we do from a medical standpoint in partnership with our clinical advisers and clinical leaders is build the information and intake to allow for essentially an understanding of their existing situation, whether or not they've tried them before, their side effect sensitivities, their nausea sensitivities. There's a tremendous amount of personalization with these medications with regard to actual goal weight loss, right? No individual body is the same. No individual person has the same ideal health outcomes. And so I think the idea of a single-dose regimen for this medication, especially given the extreme side effect nature of it and also the extreme efficacy of it is actually really well tailored. So with all of that information that then gets piped into the EMR within the platform, served up to the provider, and in partnership with the provider's expertise and their experience as well as MedMatch, which is able to educate provider on similar patients with similar dynamics and how they've had great outcomes, those decisions can be made between the patient and the provider.
Maria Ripps: Great. That's very helpful. And then can you maybe talk about how the short ending could impact the competitive setup and some of the dynamics among platforms that have been offering compounded semaglutide?
Andrew Dudum: Yes. I mean we are pretty clear with regard to what the regulation states. So my expectation is most parties in markets that have been offering commercial available, doses of semaglutide will seek to do that in the next couple of months. Again, the FDA outlined very clearly when you can and cannot compound, one, during a shortage, which has now indicated is no longer. And then second, when there's a clinical necessity for that personalization to the A facilities. So I think on an ongoing basis, outside of the next quarter, as commercial doses come out of the market, you'll see probably a smaller amount of personalization happening through the A for those that are clinically requiring that level of tailoring.
Maria Ripps: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Craig Hettenbach: Yes. Thank you. Outside of semaglutide, can you talk about just rough expectations for liraglutide in terms of possible timing for this year? And then also an update on the oral weight loss drugs. You've mentioned on prior calls as well the $100 million run rate. Just are you sustaining some of that momentum or what's the latest on the oral side?
Yemi Okupe: Yes. Thanks for the question, Craig. We see the oral business continue to remain incredibly strong. And so the guidance of expecting at least $725 million of revenue contribution from our weight business effectively excludes any contribution from the commercially available dosages of semaglutide. We set the guidance typically based upon what we have line of sight to today. There's a few things that we do know hold true and we've seen the oral business benefit as a result of it. The first is we know that our subscribers value the benefits the platform brings beyond the medication. Consumers are very motivated to lose weight and have a holistic platform to do so. We also know that consumers are looking for health and treatments from platforms that they do trust. So those are the elements being one of the reasons why the oral weight loss was able to scale so quickly. We see continued momentum even when we had personalized or compounded commercially available dosages of semaglutide on the platform. Oral offering continue to remain quite popular as a result of broader eligibility requirements, as a result of many consumers just being candidly more comfortable with the modality. And so as we look to what 2025 looks like, we do expect a continued meaningful contribution from our oral business. We're excited for liraglutide to come later this year. We expect those to be foundational pieces of the overall system for our weight loss specialty that can be supplemented, as Andrew mentioned, by the synthetic consumers for whom personalized dosages, compounded semaglutide are an effective solution for.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. And then just as a follow-up on the Hers platform reaching 30% of the business, outside of GLP-1, can you maybe just give some color in terms of some of the key categories that are driving traction on the Hers side?
Yemi Okupe: Yes. I think one of the things that we're seeing Hers really benefit from, first and foremost, there's just many of the learnings that we had around marketing effectiveness from Hims as well as strategies around personalization, we also brought over to Hers. What we also do see is that many of the categories for Hers are visible in nature. So things in dermatology that are inclusive of both skincare as well as hair loss prevention for women remain incredibly popular and that is one of our fastest scaling specialties. We also as we talked around at various points last year, see a very successful mental health business. That is also driving underneath Hers as well. And then the full ecosystem of weight, we're seeing that gain traction across both Hers and Hims. And so really we're seeing a healthy composition across multiple specialties driving the acceleration of Hers. And a large part of that is it's benefiting from many of the learnings that we had on the Hims side being able to bring those over and drive faster acceleration to the Hers first brand.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Percher of Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Eric Percher: Thank you. A question on the transition beyond commercial semaglutide. Maybe question one, what happens to the patients and subscribers currently on the commercial product? How do you think about supporting them? And what portion do you expect would be viable for personalization?
Andrew Dudum: Yes, that's a great question, Eric. I would suspect we will have to start notifying customers in the coming month and two that they will need to start looking for alternative options on the commercial dosing. Obviously, we have the expansive platform, whether it's the oral medication that are already out there or if there is some reason that this patient would qualify for some level of personalization that exists. But I would suspect, just being very direct, that a lot of those patients will try to go into the open market and try to secure a branded option in some form factors. So that transition is inevitable. I think that transition is going to have to take place and has been built into the guidance that Yemi provided.
Eric Percher: And as you look out toward the end of the year when you have lira are building on personalization, do you have a feel for what portion of the weight loss population may be spread across those? Yemi, I might also ask you. I think we have $725 million as the goal this year. We know $229 million last year for GLP-1, $100 million for weight loss. Can you help us on the equivalent or at least $100 million for weight loss, can you help us on the equivalent to that number of $725 million?
Yemi Okupe: Yes, I think what we're -- what we would expect as we look to the end of this year, given the fact that we, as Andrew mentioned, are one of the platforms has the ability to provide data insights to consumers. We also are trusted and affordable brand. We do expect to see the oral based offering be quite popular, given the fact that many other platforms will no longer be offering commercially available dosages of semaglutide. We are likely to receive benefits from that across both of our specialties on the oral side as well as liraglutide. And so I think that the competitive advantages that have served as a foundation for how we've been able to scale specialties in the past, the trusted brand, the value that we bring to consumers beyond the medication will be a critical component of maintaining our existing ecosystem of subscribers, but then also continuing to draw a broader set of subscribers to the platform.
Andrew Dudum: I would add there, Eric, one thing we talked about last quarter I think is again, as Yemi mentioned, the platform's capability to deliver a more comprehensive offering, higher touch care, increased personalization, whatever the actual medications are, is delivering what we believe is really a fantastic result. And so even when you think about the oral medications, which I think a lot of people forget, that's a category with that type of personalization that is delivering, I believe we shared 10% weight loss at more than or less than half the cost of the semaglutide, right, both the commercial and the personalization. And so I think there's a real group of customers out there. I think it's overwhelmingly the majority that is looking for handheld care. And we can help achieve weight loss in different ways and different mechanisms with different treatments. But I think that's why you're -- there's a strong degree of confidence in the delivery of that $700 plus million this year without the branded medications or the commercial doses just because I think what we see under the hood is patients really need help, they want to be cared for, they want that high touch, and that's really what the platform is able to deliver for them.
Eric Percher: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Grosslight of Citi. Please go ahead.
Daniel Grosslight: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just had really a numbers question here on the GLP-1 contribution this quarter. So it seems like for the full year, you guys were, Yemi, did you say $225 million or so of GLP-1 contribution? In my model, and frankly, I could be off in my model, but I had you doing around $75 million in 2Q and 3Q. So that would put the fourth quarter GLP-1 revenue somewhere in that $150 million range, which would be a pretty nice step up quarter-over-quarter, but then it does also apply very limited or even declining sequential growth in non-GLP-1 revenue from 3Q to 4Q. So I just wanted to put a finer point on GLP-1 contribution in the fourth quarter specifically. And then maybe if you can comment on the quarter-over-quarter trends in the non-GLP-1 revenue. Thank you.
Yemi Okupe: Yes. Thanks so much for the question, Dan. So I think across the year, but on the full year basis as well as within quarters, the vast majority of the revenue is still coming from the non-GLP-1 related offering. We still see that the overall tenured specialties remain quite durable. Much of the increase in personalized subscribers that you're seeing that number drive north of 55% is driven in part by the continued shifting of subscribers to those categories. So overall, I think it's -- we're not necessarily speaking on a quarter-to-quarter basis of the performance at a specialty level. But we do see the overall core specialties outside of GLP-1 remain quite durable. As we start to bring on some of the capabilities that Andrew mentioned in his prepared remarks such as lab testing and bring greater precision around personalization? We do see the ability for that to strengthen even further as we've seen acceleration in some of our tenured specialties in the past.
Daniel Grosslight: Okay, okay. And then on -- as we think about that $725 million of weight loss guidance for this fiscal year. I'm wondering if there's -- I don't know is there any way to partner with some of the branded companies out there. One of your competitors does have a partnership with Lilly on tirzepatide vials. I'm curious if you would pursue something on the branded side of GLP-1s outside of liraglutide or are you going to kind of stick with your knitting on what you got currently?
Andrew Dudum: Thanks, Daniel. Yes, great question. We've spoken to both of the leadership teams at Novo and Lilly and looked at the deal that Ro did with Lilly and LillyDirect. It's not off the table, right? I think the branded medications, without question, and we see this on our platform today with branded Viagra and other branded products. There is a subset of people that always wants to get them. I think right now what is challenging is twofold. One, the actual reliability of sourcing those medication and not to be kind of snickering here, but like we still really can't actually source the branded medications from our pharmacies for our own platform. And so there is a limited supply in a way that prevents us from having any durable offering on the existing Hims & Hers platform at the scale that we offer it. Obviously for other players who have smaller scale, that's a different story. But that is still a challenge. And then I think the other thing as a challenge is just the reimbursement rates are continuing to go down. And so frankly the reliability that we can say to a patient that, hey, you're going to have this price and here's a guaranteed kind of locked-in experience. It's kind of crumbling a little bit. And so I think we still need to see how that pans out from a customer relationship standpoint. We want to have consistency. We want to have price transparency like we've always talked about. We want to have seamlessness. And the current ecosystem across supply chain, reimbursement rate, cost, it just really doesn't hit those marks in any way yet. Hopefully, those do change, right, because again, as a platform that likes to be Switzerland, we benefit from having more offerings on the platform and our patients also benefit. So I think we're keeping our eyes open and seeing how the dynamics change and always have a really open conversation with any of those companies that can be helpful in getting more breadth to the platform for these patients.
Daniel Grosslight: Makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald of Needham. Please go ahead.
Ryan MacDonald: Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a great quarter. As we look at the GLP-1 business, you talked about personalized and commercial. Can you give us a sense of what the rough mix is across that? And then as you -- as we get past Q1 here, is there any risk, whether it be from a legal or regulatory perspective on continuing to offer the personalized version in your view? Thanks.
Yemi Okupe: Maybe I can take the first part and then I'll hand the second part over to Andrew to address. I think we initially launched the platform with just commercially available dosages. What we see in general in our platform is, as Andrew mentioned, many of the folks that are coming to our platform have come and have had struggles with GLP-1s in the past. That was the genesis behind one of the reasons behind why we very quickly looked to roll out the personalized dosages as well. And so we see between that as well as the other benefits that we offer on the platform, the high-touch provider engagement. Is it given the fact that many folks have already experienced side effect concerns with the commercially available dosages, a majority of individuals on the platform today are utilizing personalized dosages versus the commercially available dosages. Andrew, you're going to take the second part?
Andrew Dudum: Yes, sure. Yes, I think the regulatory framework for the allowance of personalization and actually what that means, right, to Maria's question, the documentation, the clinical necessity of it, what the actual experience of it looks like, what personalization means from an actual dosing standpoint and a difference from commercially available drug. All of this is very clear and regulated. And so we play by the rules and the rules are quite clear. And so I don't expect there to be meaningful conflict when it comes to the personalization standpoint. I think historically, the broad industry, inclusive of the pharmaceutical companies have recognized and respected, I think, the need for this type of clinical personalization of medication. I think what they have always really had issue with understandably just given the bottom line implications is the mass scale production through the 503Bs, right? Commercial mass scale production is something that they would prefer doesn't exist. It is again regulatorily allowed. But with that closing as a result of the shortage, I think you'll see a meaningfully smaller number of players in market. I think the necessity for kind of a high filter of who those customers are and what the experience looks like and how it's documented will be very important and ultimately I think will be respected by most of those industry leaders.
Ryan MacDonald: Thanks. I appreciate all the color there. And then as you think about the liraglutide launch, any more specifics you can give us on sort of what we should expect in terms of the time line for when that will be become available on Hims? And then how are you thinking from a pricing strategy perspective for generic liraglutide relative to the ranges that you have of orals at $70 up to compounded GLP-1 at $165? How should we think about the -- where that could come in the pricing range here? Thanks.
Andrew Dudum: Yes, that's a great question. From a timing standpoint, I would expect sometime midyear or early second half of the year to bring that to market. On the pricing side, our ambition is always to bring this to market in the most mass affordable way possible. Now with liraglutide, it's a bit of a challenge because you have more medication that's needed, given it's a daily injection versus a weekly injection. You've got more sterile needles that are required on a weekly basis given this. So everything from raw API to packaging is more expensive. So I would suspect that there's going to be some trickle-down effect that results in us having a similar price point to the commercial dosing in the couple of hundred buck range. But again, I think our ambition will always try to get to scale quickly, negotiate either through our own third-party partners or through the verticalization of our own infrastructure to be able to then bring that price down over the coming year and bring it to people in a way that ultimately delivers great outcomes. And I think with liraglutide, the base level dosing has okay results compared to the newer generation GLP-1s. But there's a lot of people that have very strong results when you pair it with other treatments, whether it's compounds on the oral side or healthy lifestyle or calorie deficit or even personalized doses of the liraglutide. So I think we have a lot of excitement for that medication because we think it will be a nice thing to add to the arsenal and be very successful for a certain group of people.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler of Seaport Research. Please go ahead.
Aaron Kessler: Hey, guys. Maybe just on the kind of for the testing, you kind of mentioned menopause testing as well as low T or testosterone on them. Any thoughts on timing potentially for that offering? And then just maybe how to think about kind of that growth versus revenue per sub for the year as well? Thank you.
Andrew Dudum: Yes. Thanks, Aaron. We're really excited about the whole body testing. I think you'll hopefully see us start to get that in the market in the first half of the year, but it's not early second as well as we integrate [indiscernible]. And that's going to really unlock not only more precise treatments, vitamin supplementation, but also, I think, multi-condition treatments because you're able to really start to get earlier biomarkers for things like metabolic disorders, insulin resistance, cardio disorders on the lipid profile side. So I think there's going to be a real expansion opportunity there that can expand not only the number of customers that are coming to us every day, but also just the stickiness of the relationship. And then Yemi I'll let you speak a little bit on the second half.
Yemi Okupe: Yes. On the second half, we do expect continued expansion on revenue per sub. I think the pace of that will vary depending on a few factors. One is just, as Andrew mentioned, as we start to roll out more multi-condition treatments, those typically carry a bit of a premium to the existing treatments on the platform. So that will drive some expansion. And as we see continued adoption on both the oral as well as liraglutide in the back half of this year that's likely you'll see some expansion in revenue per subscriber as well.
Aaron Kessler: Great. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. With that, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",split transcript is available for premium subscribers only.,HIMS
2024,Q1,2024-05-02,"Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Cloudflare First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] 
 I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Phil Winslow, Vice President of Strategic Finance, Treasury and Investor Relations. You may begin. 
Philip Winslow: Thank you for joining us today to discuss Cloudflare's financial results for the first quarter of 2024. With me on the call, we have Matthew Prince, Co-Founder and CEO; Michelle Zatlyn, Co-Founder, President and COO; Thomas Seifert, CFO; and Mark Anderson, President of Revenue.

 Before wrapping up, please save the date for our Investor Day on Thursday, May 30, which is being held in conjunction with our user conference, Cloudflare Connect, in New York City. A live webcast will also be accessible from our Investor Relations website. 
 Now I'd like to turn the call over to Matthew. 
Matthew Prince: Thank you, Phil. We had a very strong quarter. We achieved revenue of $378.6 million, up 30% year-over-year. We added 122 new large customers, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year and now have 2,878 large customers, up 33% year-over-year. Revenue contribution from our large customers during the quarter increased to 67%, up from 62% in the first quarter last year. Digging into our largest customers, we added a record number of net new customers year-over-year spending more than $100,000, $500,000 and $1 million on an annualized basis. We are successfully moving upmarket and becoming a larger and more strategic vendor to more and more of our customers. Our dollar-based net retention held steady quarter-over-quarter at 115%. Our gross margin was 79.5%, again, above our long-term target range of 75% to 77% and up from 78.9% last quarter. We delivered operating profit of $42.4 million, representing an operating margin of 11.2%. Our gross margin and operating margin performance underscore Cloudflare's efficiency and increasing operational excellence. We again meaningfully outperformed on free cash flow, generating $35.6 million during the quarter. We have our hands firmly on the levers of our business. I'm proud of the fact that our team has been able to continue to build our network, service larger and larger customers and launch entirely new categories of products including in the AI space, while remaining disciplined with our CapEx, gross margin, operating margin and cash flow. 
 We have an elegant business that works because how all the pieces fit together and leverage our hyper-efficient network infrastructure in a way that we believe no competitors can match. If I reflect back on the history of Cloudflare, it divides fairly neatly into 7-year eras. The first 7 years, 2010 to through 2017, were all about engineering and little else, figuring out if it was even possible to build the revolutionary network we have today. The next 7 were all about product, taking that incredible engineering and packaging it up. As we got greater product, we didn't stop being incredible at engineering. We continue to build on and improve that foundation. Looking forward to the next 7 years, we will continue to be the best in the world in engineering and product, but we'll add to that world-class sales and marketing. 
 To that end, just 90 days ago, we announced that Mark Anderson will be joining Cloudflare as our new President of Revenue to accelerate our next phase of growth at scale. He hit the ground running and has been enthusiastically embraced by our team. I thought it made sense for Mark to say a few words on what he's seeing in his first 90 days. Mark? 
Mark Anderson: Thanks, Matthew. I know Cloudflare and the team as a Board member for the last 4.5 years. But the thing that surprised me the most getting in the trenches is just how incredible the product is. I know this space, and we are leaps and bounds better than any of our competitors. What also surprised me is how much room for improvement there is for Cloudflare's go-to-market organization. The last year has been about clearing away for a world-class enterprise sales organization to emerge. We've got some great people, great experiences. And gosh, I could see the early results. I'm now planning to step on the gas, building and enabling this team that can take Cloudflare's best-of-breed products to every single enterprise everywhere in the world. I don't see anything stopping us from becoming one of the most strategic key vendors to every Fortune 500 company out there. I couldn't be more excited. 
Matthew Prince: Thanks, Mark. Some of the benefits of a world-class leader are hard to measure in the short term, but I'll give you one that can be clearly measured and that stood out to me. The number of applicants for strategic account and enterprise sales positions increased 56% in March versus February following Mark Anderson's appointment. We're definitely hiring. Across all positions, we had over 350,000 applicants in Q1, up 47% over the same quarter last year. We added several senior go-to-market leaders with proven track records in their areas of expertise, including a new Chief Partner Officer, a new Head of Global Sales and renewals and multiple regional strategic account sales leaders. If you're a sales professional who wants to win with great products and world-class leadership, the word is out, Cloudflare is the place to bet the next stage of your career. Beyond incredible hiring, our sales productivity from existing team members improved year-over-year. Sales cycles were similar to last quarter and new pipeline attainment exceeded our expectations. I don't think Mark can take credit for any of that yet, which is actually very encouraging. We have room for improvement, as he said. But now we have the right leadership and foundation to take our go-to-market efforts to the next level. I feel extremely confident and clear in the long-term opportunity that Cloudflare has in front of us. 
 In the short term, however, my crystal ball is less clear. We see a lot of signals based on our privileged position running a good chunk of the Internet. Even without that visibility, if you've been watching the news at all, it's clear that the near-term outlook for the world is uncertain, increasing tensions in the Middle East, no end in sight on the Russia-Ukraine war and potential signs of instability in Asia. It's not at all certain on anything we see that things will get worse. But we do know from even recent history that macro factors can impact short-term sales trends. 
 We're fortunate that we're in the cybersecurity space, perhaps one of the few sectors that can actually benefit from increased global tensions. We're already seeing that, especially in our government business, but we also want to acknowledge the risky world we live in; and b, as we always have been, prudent and careful with our investments and our forecast as we look into what is a short-term cloudy crystal ball. That served us well in the past, and I think will prove to be the disciplined approach once again going forward. The short term is uncertain, the long term is bright, and so in the medium term, we're going to keep our hands firmly on the levers of our business and thoughtfully invest in our go-to-market efforts in great engineering and in disruptive new products that deliver incredible value to our customers. That's the winning strategy, especially in uncertain times. 
 Speaking of customers, let me share some great wins for the quarter. The National Cyber Security Centre, the U.K.'s technical authority for cyber threats, signed a 3-year contract with Cloudflare to deliver its protective domain name service. PDNS protects over 1,400 U.K. organizations in central government, local government, health care and emergency services from malware and cyber threats. This was a very competitive process with several vendors and a rigorous technical evaluation. We tightly collaborate with Accenture, a partner we're looking forward to working with even more closely on this landmark U.K. public sector win. A leading technology company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a 3-year, $40 million pool of funds contract, $8.5 million of which are expansion. 
 This deal is an example of a strategic platform deal that we're increasingly seeing customers opt for with a rate card for more than 40 Cloudflare products and services. These include Cloudflare One, Magic Transit, R2 as well as Workers AI, which the customer was quick to dive in and start trialing. As a textbook land-and-expand story, this customer first came to us in 2017 for our application security services and has continued to expand over the years with this deal encompassing the vast majority of Cloudflare's platform. 
 A Fortune 100 financial services company signed a similar 4-year, $10 million pool of funds deal. This customer represents our largest new logo win with a major financial institution. We successfully completed 6 different proof of concepts and the main business drivers for going with Cloudflare were resilience, the operational efficiency from a single unified platform and our ability to meet data sovereignty requirements with complete flexibility at the country level, a requirement that no other vendor was able to accommodate. We anticipate this deal will serve as a beachhead for us to win more financial service customers looking for the same benefits. 
 A large international energy company signed a 5-year, $4.5 million contract. This new customer is going all in with Cloudflare's SASE platform, with 6,000 Zero Trust seats along with CASB, DLP, Browser Isolation, MAGIC WAN and Magic Firewall. Competing against a first-generation Zero Trust vendor, our focus on scalability and efficiency as well as the ability to consolidate several vendors due to the significant value in our overall portfolio were key factors delivering this win. 
 A large financial institution in Latin America signed a 2-year, $1.3 million contract for Zero Trust seats for their employees and contractors, along with our application security services. This is a very competitive process with 11 participants. Cloudflare's pace of innovation, speed of deployment, superior performance and integrated platform with DDoS and WAF for agentless access set us apart from the rest. 
 A leading digital marketplace signed a 3-year, $880,000 contract for Zero Trust, MAGIC WAN and application security. The company was looking to simplify, optimize and reduce latency in their security architecture and WAN platform. With their incumbent solution, this company found it difficult to roll out consistent security posture where they can manage security and network together. With Cloudflare, this customer is able to consolidate 7 incumbent products onto Cloudflare modernized network, merging network and security solutions on our unified platform with a single control plane. 
 A Fortune 100 government-sponsored financial services company signed a 3-year, $3 million contract for DDoS protection with our Magic Transit, Magic Firewall and DNS firewall products. This customer was looking for a solution that was more resilient, performant and better architected than their incumbent solution. With Cloudflare's unified platform, this customer is able to improve attack mitigation outcomes on a single pane of glass and eliminate the need for dedicated teams to run and manage multiple products. Another deal with this customer is already underway. 
 A leading construction company signed a 3-year, $720,000 contract for Zero Trust, Magic WAN and Magic Firewall. This customer is looking to shift from a legacy hub-and-spoke architecture, eliminating costly hardware appliances at job sites to a modern, cloud-native SASE model. Cloudflare won against the first-generation Zero Trust vendor due to our superior network, pace of innovation, ease of use and speed of deployment. 
 A U.S. government agency signed a 1-year, $800,000 contract for Zero Trust, Magic WAN and R2 object storage. The agency was looking to modernize infrastructure and eliminate a complex network of multiple legacy point solution vendors. Cloudflare displaced a first-generation Zero Trust provider due to our ease of use, speed of deployment and integrated platform with a single control plane. These are all great wins. And again, I think what we're seeing is more and more customers are turning to the complete Cloudflare platform. 
 Before I hand it over to Thomas, I wanted to spend a couple of minutes talking about Cloudflare Workers, our developer platform. The last few months were incredible for the entire Workers' ecosystem. First, we crossed over 2 million active developers building applications on Cloudflare Workers. Second, in April, we GA-ed a number of key products like D1, our serverless SQL database; Hyperdrive, which makes any traditional database perform like it's globally distributed; and Workers AI, which allows developers to run and tune AI models across our global network. 
 We're ahead of schedule rolling out GPUs across our network and now have them running in more than 150 cities globally, making us what we believe is the most widely distributed AI cloud by a huge margin. Our next generation of servers that begin to roll out in Q2 have GPUs built in by default and will support faster inference and even larger, more complicated models. Developers are building incredible new applications using Workers AI, and we're making it increasingly easy for them. 
 We added support for Python, the second most popular programming language generally and the most common language for AI applications. We rolled out our partnership with Hugging Face, making it one-click simple to deploy most of their catalog of models to Cloudflare's network. And we added other bleeding edge models, including releasing Meta's Llama-3 production simultaneously the day it was announced. 
 One of my favorite aspects of my job is I feel like I get to see into the future when I talk to developers who are building on Cloudflare Workers. I'm proud that we're delivering the tools they need to build applications that are intelligent, scalable and lightning-fast around the world. Internally and externally, our innovation engine continues to fire on all cylinders. And as I said, I've never been more excited about the future for Cloudflare, the Internet and us users who will get to enjoy the benefits of all of this innovation in so many aspects of our lives. 
 With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas. Thomas, take it away. 
Thomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We are pleased with our execution during the first quarter. Sales productivity improved year-over-year again this quarter. Sales cycles were similar to last quarter, and our new pipeline attainment exceeded our expectations. The quarter was highlighted by sustained momentum with large customers including our largest new logo win with a major financial institution and continued progress in the public sector, including our largest contract with a new foreign government customers. 
 We're also seeing security remain a high priority for our customers given continued geopolitical uncertainty and high-profile cyberattacks, driving demand for our application and network security businesses as well as Cloudflare One. We also maintained our strong commitment to being fiscally responsible and act as good stewards of investors' capital. During the first quarter, operating profit more than doubled year-over-year, and we generated strong free cash flow of $35.6 million, driven by a notable uptick in collections on our accounts receivable. 
 Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the first quarter increased 30% year-over-year to $378.6 million. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 52% of revenue and increased 28% year-over-year. EMEA represented 28% of revenue and increased 35% year-over-year. APAC represented 12% of revenue and increased 22% year-over-year. 
 Turning to our customer metrics. In the first quarter, we had about 197,000 paying customers, representing an increase of 17% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with about 2,900 large customers, representing an increase of 33% year-over-year and an addition of 122 large customers in the quarter. As Matthew mentioned, we were pleased to see revenue contribution from large customers during the quarter increased again to 67% of revenue, up from 62% in the first quarter last year. We also added a record number of net new customers year-over-year across all 3 large customer cohorts, that is those spending more than $100,000, $500,000 and $1 million on an annualized basis with Cloudflare. 
 Our dollar-based net retention rate was 115% during the first quarter and consistent sequentially. As we mentioned last quarter, there can be some variability in this metric quarter-to-quarter, but we continue to believe the prior decelerating trend in DNR is stabilizing near these levels. 
 Moving to gross margin. First quarter gross margin was 79.5%, representing an increase of 60 basis points sequentially and an increase of 170 basis points year-over-year. Network CapEx represented 8% of revenue in the first quarter as we continue to benefit from our focus on driving great efficiency from our infrastructure and the uniqueness of our platform to onboard new workloads. We expect network CapEx to be 10% to 12% of revenue in fiscal 2024. 
 Turning to operating expenses. First quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 3% year-over-year to 68% as we remain committed to driving higher productivity and greater efficiency across our operations. Our total number of employees increased 9% year-over-year, bringing our total head count to 3,704 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $156.8 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased to 41% from 42% in the same quarter last year. Over the last 5 quarters, we focused on refining our go-to-market strategies and operations. We are encouraged by the double-digit year-over-year improvement in sales productivity that we again delivered during the first quarter, which continues the upward trend from the trough of early last year from the productivity levels we consistently achieved in 2021 and early 2022. 
 We expect this positive trajectory to continue based on the analysis of our pipeline and with the onboarding of Mark Anderson and the other senior go-to-market leaders Matthew referenced earlier. As you've heard us say many times, we are committed to the underlying unit economics of our business and make data-driven decisions to pace hiring. The improvement in sales productivity and other leading indicators of our business give us confidence to invest in additional go-to-market improvements and further expand sales capacity. 
 As a result, we intend to accelerate head count additions in the coming quarters as compared to the first quarter. Research and development expenses were $58.7 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased to 16% from 18% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $43.2 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 11% from 12% in the second quarter last year. Operating income was $42.4 million compared to $19.4 million in the same period last year. First quarter operating margin was 11.2%, an increase of 450 basis points year-over-year. These results highlight our continued focus on becoming more efficient and more productive given that operational excellence is a long-term competitive advantage. 
 Turning to net income on the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $58.2 million or a diluted net income of $0.16 per share. We ended the first quarter with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $35.6 million in the first quarter or 9% of revenue compared to $13.9 million or 5% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in at $1.343 billion, representing an increase of 8% sequentially and 40% year-over-year. Current RPO was 70% of total RPO. 
 Moving to guidance for the second quarter and full year 2024. We are pleased with our execution during the first quarter. However, ongoing mixed macroeconomic data points and heightened geopolitical uncertainty [indiscernible] remind us that we continue to operate in a business environment that remains challenging to predict. As a result, we remain prudent in our outlook for 2024. 
 For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $393.5 million to $394.5 million, representing an increase of 28% year-over-year. We expect operating income in the range of $35 million to $36 million, and we expect an effective tax rate of 10%. We expect diluted net income per share of $0.14, assuming approximately 360 million shares outstanding. 
 For the full year 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $1.648 billion to $1.652 billion, representing an increase of 27% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $160 million to $164 million. We expect an effective tax rate of 10% for 2024 and we expect diluted net income per share over that period to be $0.60 to $0.61, assuming approximately 361 million shares outstanding. We expect free cash flow to be relatively consistent with operating profit for the full year 2024, with the first half lower and the second half higher compared with operating profit. 
 In closing, our team remains committed to driving operational excellence, ensuring long-term growth and delivering significant shareholder value. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication to our mission as well as our customers for trusting us to help them solve some of the hardest problems that they face when modernizing, transforming and securing their businesses. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. 
Matthew Hedberg: Maybe one for Matthew first and then one for Thomas. Matthew, our checks continue to show you're becoming more relevant in SASE. Can you talk a bit more about the progress in that market and why you appear to be taking share on what it feels like a more competitive market today? 
Matthew Prince: Yes. I think we're really proud of our team for our ability to execute there. SASE, for those people who aren't as familiar with, is the forward proxy products that we sell. It helps make sure that employees who are using the Internet online are protected from malware, protected from malicious sites that the networks that you use as part of your business are as secure as possible. We were able to build our SASE platform on top of Cloudflare's existing network. And the advantage of that is that it means that you get a true platform. Not only do you get those forward proxy products, but a lot of times, we're bundling in our reverse proxy products. And that total solution is extremely compelling in the marketplace, and it's something that no other SASE vendor can match. And so I think we are a newer entrant into this space, but we've caught up very quickly. You can see we have improved more in the Gartner rankings, in the Forrester rankings than any other vendor in this space, and companies are taking notice. 
 The other thing that I think everybody really loves is most security companies think that performance is sort of a nice to have, not a must have. We never accepted that. And so our SASE platform is significantly better and faster than anyone else. And so anyone who's listening to this if you're frustrated with the VPN that you have to log into, if you're frustrated with whatever service it's providing that, even if it's a new cloud service, if it's slowing you down and making it harder for you to do work, give us a call at Cloudflare because we can actually improve that and make it significantly better. And that's what we're seeing from customer after customer after customer is that our next-generation SASE platform is winning in this space. 
Matthew Hedberg: Excellent. And then maybe just a quick one for Thomas. I know calculated billings isn't a great metric for you guys based on your model, but I'm wondering how we should think about billings in the context of your expanded usage-based pricing model. 
Thomas Seifert: Yes. Especially if we compare fourth quarter to this quarter, fourth quarter was a very strong quarter, both in terms of new business as well as in terms of renewal. But what made this quarter even more special from a comparability perspective, as you heard Matthew talked about some very large significant deals, both in the federal as well as in the commercial space. Some of these very large deals are pool of fund deals, and they have a very different shape to them from current RPO and billings perspective. And one indication is RPO, it's up 40% year-over-year, where you see this momentum more neutralized and some of the noise taken away. But without any doubt this business is becoming more complex. And this is then also reflected in some more noise in -- from a quarter-to-quarter perspective. But overall, we are really happy with the performance in the quarter. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski from Wells Fargo. 
Andrew Nowinski: Great. Congrats on a nice quarter. I wanted to start with a question on Workers AI because I think it's one of the most exciting products that you have in your portfolio. You mentioned Workers AI and developers are using your platform to build some new AI applications. Can you just give us some examples of maybe what those apps are and why they chose Workers AI to build on among the many other alternatives out there? 
Matthew Prince: Yes, Andrew, I -- as I said, one of the most fun parts of my job is getting to see what developers are building. So let me give you a handful of examples off the top of my head and see if any of these are interesting. You can stop me if they get boring. I think one of the largest e-commerce platforms out there is starting to use Workers AI to do image classification and generate keywords for their shops. A start-up in the drone space is taking imagery and turning it into 3D models and using Workers AI to do that. They service around the globe, and so that's interesting. A handful of the public platform companies are using Workers AI for video description, transcribing, translation, all those things as AI. A multinational online food ordering company, every once in a while, a restaurant does submit a picture for one of the dishes. And so they're actually experimenting with Workers AI to generate pictures of the food that you're serving. Hopefully, they disclosed that it's not an actual picture. 
 A handful of photo and video editing platforms are using Workers AI or evaluating it in order to do image enhancement and make that better. There's a start-up that's generating songs in whatever language you speak and local languages and they're using Workers AI in order to power their song generation platform. We're thinking about a large consulting companies, public companies, the big gaming company, all of which are actually worried about Shadow AI, and so they're actually using Workers AI gateway in order to understand how their own teams are using Workers. A start-up is using a series of enterprise summarization tools where they can look at a bunch of e-mails and very quickly summarize them into executive reports. There's another start-up that's creating an AI search engine. There's a public company in the financial services space that's doing real-time fraud detection. There are people who are finding ways to -- in the renovation space, how can you imagine, before you hire a contractor, what the space is going to look like in another sense. I mean I'll just go on and on and on with example after example after example. And our team just hands these to us every day, and it's so exciting to see what people are doing in this space and the different ways that they're using it. 
 In terms of why, what is it about Cloudflare that's unique? I think there are sort of 3 things that stand out to me about it. The first is just the performance of Cloudflare Workers AI because we are distributed around the world and today, over 150 locations globally, as we serve customers that serve a global audience, we can just give them a much better experience in having to ship all of your code back to some central location. 
 The second is that we can actually be significantly more cost effective. If you're using one of the big hyperscale clouds in order to do any sort of AI task, it's up to you to manage efficiency. You have to make sure that you're getting the most out of the GPU that you're renting whereas what we do is much more of a serverless AI model where you only pay for the task that you actually run. So especially in a lot of the start-ups, they're finding that they can just get significant better efficiency, significant better cost if they use our platform in order to deliver that AI experience. And then the third thing is that because we got it distributed globally and because of the fact that we have such a rich ecosystem that we've built, where you can get a soup-to-nuts AI experience, that's allowing people to actually fine-tune their models. 
 And so my silly example of this is that if you have an AI that's responding back to a British user and describing what something looks like versus a U.S. user, in the U.K., you want color to be spelled C-O-L-O-U-R. In the U.S., you wanted to be sell C-O-L-O-R, because we can regionally tune that. We can actually correspond all of the local and regional differences all around the world. That's something that you don't get anywhere else. And that, I think, is going to be really important for these inference tasks. They're going to want to be run locally for both the normative and experienced reasons, but also for the regulatory reasons that are out there. So I'm super excited about what we're seeing in the AI space. I'm really proud of our team for being ahead of our rollout. We had to actually physically get gear to over 150 cities worldwide. And we're still on track to, by the end of this year, we think, be able to do AI inference from nearly every location that makes up Cloudflare network. 
Andrew Nowinski: Well, that was an incredibly comprehensive answer. Maybe just a quick one for Thomas. You guys have made some great new hires beefing up your go-to-market on the channel side with Tom Evans and of course, Mark Anderson. I know you talked about the uncertain macro in the short term, but I was wondering if you're factoring in any sort of conservatism into your annual outlook for the go-to-market changes that you guys are -- might make as a reason for perhaps not raising your guidance despite the strong Q1. 
Thomas Seifert: As you know, conservative is not a word that we use. When we talk about giving guidance, we tend to be thoughtful and prudent about it. And of course, it's a balance of the tailwinds we see, but also the uncertainty that is out there and every major go-to-market transformation. In our case, it's actually more an evolution. There is risk, and it's reflected in our guidance, too. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. 
Brent Thill: Matthew, on federal, the last couple of quarters, you had a theme of some pretty big wins. And I'm just curious if you could give us a sense of where you think penetration is. And is it fair to say the flywheel is spinning faster here, at least from what you guys are giving us in terms of the breadcrumbs around the federal business? 
Matthew Prince: Yes. I think federal is exciting for us. Last year, we achieved FedRAMP certification. That's opened a lot of FedRAMP -- excuse me, of federal deals to us. I think we've always had a great relationship with a lot of the members of the federal government. I think the thing, which is hard to appreciate that, as I talked to our federal customers, is how much they appreciate that when they ask us to help with something, we step up and help. So this year in the United States, obviously, is an election year, we've been running the Athenian Project since 2016, which provides our services at no cost to anyone who is helping administer an election anywhere in the United States. 
 We've done similar things around the rest of the world. We've worked with the White House on a number of initiatives, including Project Safe Schools (sic) [ Project Cybersafe Schools ] in order to protect the most vulnerable schools and communities across the country. And that is all the foundation which I think has built an incredible amount of trust and an incredible amount of goodwill in the federal space. And so today, as the world is getting scarier and scarier and we're seeing more and more cyberattacks, the federal -- our federal business, I think, is being driven by the fact that we have great products, the fact that we have the certifications that are required to serve the federal government and the fact that we've built an incredible relationship as being not just a trusted vendor, but a true partner where we have helped make sure that when there's any public institution that is in true need anywhere across the country, we step up and help. And I think that's now turning into more and more business that is also generating significant revenue for us. 
Brent Thill: And then just quickly for you and Thomas, this AI CapEx war debate, you saw all the big hyperscalers take CapEx way up. How do you do this efficiently? You mentioned bringing gear to 150 cities. You're ahead in GPU rollout. Explain how you're -- is this only which way -- only one way to do with costs? Or is there a way you can do this in a more efficient way than maybe others? 
Matthew Prince: I'll start and then Thomas may have more to add. I think the thing, which is really magical about Cloudflare's business, which is really elegant, is that it all fits together so well. So for instance, as we sell more of our Zero Trust and SASE products, those are extremely high-margin products, and they don't require a significant additional amount of CapEx. That then frees up our ability to invest that CapEx in other areas, including in the AI space. I think we made some very smart decisions, specifically reserving space and the equipment that we deployed knowing that AI would be part of our story at some point in the future. And so we really wanted to make sure that's the case. That means that as we deploy CapEx, it's literally not shipping an entire server to support AI, but shipping just the GPU cards that go into existing servers that are in the field. That reduces the amount of CapEx that has to be deployed. And again, it works because it is all running on one unified network. The fact that every server across Cloudflare's entire platform is capable of performing any function that we need, that has allowed us an enormous amount of flexibility in how we can deploy things and has helped us. 
 The other part is that a lot of the hyperscale players, what they're really doing is they're renting out a full GPU or a full machine, whereas our business is a little bit different. We're selling the actual work that those machines do. What that means is that we can then be much more efficient at figuring out how to allow multi-tenant use of the equipment that we have provided, and we can make sure that the utilization is extremely high. So if -- and again, these are -- I don't know the exact numbers for each of the hyperscalers and they all have different -- slightly different characteristics. But in the average hyperscaler, if they're getting maybe 20% utilization out of a CPU or GPU resources that they've deployed, we can often be many times that in terms of the utilization where in CPUs we're seeing almost 80% utilization. So that efficiency allows us to get more out of every CapEx dollar. 
 Finally, I would say that inference is different than training. And so you need different resources for that. You don't need necessarily the most cutting-edge GPUs in order to do inference tasks. And so that has meant that we haven't had to chase down what is a -- GPUs that have limited quantity. It's also meant that we can be much smarter about picking and choosing between different GPU vendors and matching workloads to whoever it is that can provide the best service. And I think over time, that gives us a significant advantage over people who are just trying to rent one particular type of GPU or rent that and let their customers figure out how to be as efficient as possible. 
Thomas Seifert: There's not much to add to this. We were at 8% to 9% of revenue with network CapEx in the first quarter. We said the year will be close in the range of 10 to 12, and this includes the rollout of GPU capacity pretty much to every server and every location we have. I think the -- just to underline what Matthew just said, the huge variety of use cases we see and that Matthew talked about when he talked about Workers AI deployment with developers gives us huge insight in how we optimize this capacity, and there's not one card that is good for every inference task. And this ability to optimize our investment mix in GPU capacity to that need based on the huge variety of use cases we see is, I think, an additional big factor that allows us to be so efficient with our CapEx spend. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein from Truist Securities. 
Joel Fishbein: Great execution in the quarter, 30% top line growth. Matthew, one for you and a follow-up for Thomas. Matthew, you talked a lot about hiring of go-to-market talent. And just inflecting on that, how is -- there seems to be a war on talent for AI engineers. You've seen a few companies do acqui-hires where they're just draining talent. Curious where Cloudflare is with hiring and retaining talent and if it's fitting into your normal compensation things, capacity. 
Matthew Prince: Yes. I mean I think we are very fortunate that across the board, we are seen as a place where if you want to be innovative, if you want to invent the future, or if you want to sell really incredible products or help market them or frankly, work on some of the hardest public policy issues or get to work with Thomas on the world's coolest finance team, that you -- that Cloudflare is a place where you can go. And so when you see someone like Mark Anderson, when you see someone like Stephanie Cohen, you see the engineers who are coming to Cloudflare every day. We had 350,000 people apply to work at Cloudflare in Q1 for, I don't know, 250 jobs roughly. That's extraordinary. And that is -- and that's up over what was an extraordinary Q1 of last year, up almost 50% year-over-year. So I'm -- I think that the talent war is real, but we are in a fortunate position where we are winning that war. We have not seen an uptick in any regrettable attrition. It's been -- it's -- I think we're very fortunate to be working on some of the world's hardest problems. And some of the smartest people in the world want to come and help us on this. 
Joel Fishbein: That's great. And Thomas, for you, just in terms of sales productivity, really strong improvement again. Do you expect that to change with the acceleration of new hires, sales hires? Or are you hiring more experienced people so their time to productivity is shorter? 
Thomas Seifert: This is, of course, what the goal is. But even if you hire experienced people, there's a ramp-up curve that comes along with it. We are moving up market. We are getting to larger and larger customers and more strategic accounts. They're more complex. There's more overlay. So this balances itself out. We hire trade talent. We see great productivity improvement. But as I said earlier, every transformation or evolution in the go-to-market side comes with potential risk, and we try to be thoughtful when we give guidance that there might be downside implied. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. 
Jonathan Ho: I just wanted to follow up on that last question and just try to better understand from a sales productivity standpoint, what inning are we in? And where do you think Mark can add the most value? 
Matthew Prince: I'll start and then Thomas can maybe add some more if he has it. I think that -- I think we are still early in the journey of being really great at Enterprise. I think in Mark's comments, he said that our product is great, but our ability to really sell to large enterprises to understand their needs and drive more of a strategic relationship is something that we are continuing to work on. That is -- I think the last 18 months were all about us sort of cleaning up the sales organization. And now with Mark on board, it's all about now how do we get the real professionals on board, where we can become that strategic vendor for literally every large company in the world. There is no large company that doesn't have a need for what it is that we sell. 
 What I think is really encouraging is where we have done that, where we have really nailed that. We are becoming one1 of the largest IT vendors for those companies. And some of those are very large companies. I think the fact that we won a very large financial services organization and became a strategic vendor for them, that -- and that, as I said, is a beachhead for us to go in and take much more share. Almost all the financial -- major financial services institutions in the United States use us for something. But I want to say that we're a strategic vendor for many of them yet. We're going to be. And we can do so many things in the networking and security space that they absolutely need. And as we, I think, mature that process, it's great. I can't imagine someone who is better for this role than Mark Anderson. And again, it was not the plan when we added him to our Board 4 years ago, but he's gotten to know us over that period of time. And it's just incredible to see the high caliber of talent who is excited to lean forward and work with him going forward. 
Jonathan Ho: Excellent. And just a quick follow-up. Is there something specific in the macro that's maybe causing you a little bit of pause? Anything that you can sort of point to in terms of that additional concern on the outlook. 
Matthew Prince: I think that we get a lot of signal based on where we sit on the Internet. And what I would say right now is that it's not any one thing pointing in any one clear direction. But there's a lot of noise pointing in a number of different directions that give us, I think, reason to be cautious. And I think that, that is in our very nature, is always taking as much signal being data-driven and making sure that we're making investments in a responsible way. And so I think the obvious thing is the geopolitical uncertainty around the world. That absolutely causes changes in buying behavior. 
 On the other hand, some of that changes -- those changes in buying behavior have been positive for us as we're seeing, especially in our government business, pick up because of that uncertainty. So there are puts and takes that are out there. What we want to do is just make sure that we are being prudent and responsible and thoughtful as we make investments and as we think through how to handle the responsibility that we have with investors capital and that they've trusted us with. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Blakey from KeyBanc Capital Markets. 
Thomas Blakey: Matt, I was wondering about the recent Nefeli acquisition around multi-cloud networking and a possible acceleration to Act 2, this prior question on Zero Trust SASE services. I guess specifically, maybe because of the impetus of the deal, maybe there was some pent-up demand that maybe this addition of multi-cloud networking technology could maybe expand Cloudflare's reach from a Zero Trust perspective, I'd love to hear your comments there. And I have a follow-up. 
Matthew Prince: Yes. We're incredibly excited to have the Nefeli team on board. We want to make it -- we think the space that Cloudflare competes in is in the networking and in the security space. And so making it very easy to get traffic on to our network to connect to any other cloud is just a critical aspect and it seemed like something that we were either going to have to build or buy. And we came across the Nefeli team in part because they came in through our own launch pad program, which is a program having customers that -- and start-ups that use Cloudflare's resources and especially our workers' platform in order to build. 
 What is powerful about that is we use that same platform to build ourselves. And so when we find great teams working in a space that we think is exciting, building on the same platform, the same platform that our own team uses, that just decreases the risk of any kind of technical integration, any kind of sort of Frankenstein-ing  of your platform that's out there. And so the Nefeli team was really great, and we were excited to announce it. We think that, again, our hurdle rate for acquisitions and M&A remains very, very high. But these -- some of these small acquisitions, where we found great teams working in interesting spaces, has worked incredibly well for us. 
 A couple of other examples that are very similar. Baselime that we acquired is, again, giving server observability to our platform. It's one of the #1 things that developers on our platform were looking for. And again, another time where we found someone that is using our own platform in order to build out a great observability platform there. PartyKit, which is a real-time integration service, again, it's just a natural extension of what it is that we're doing. So again, none of these are very large acquisitions, but I think they're extremely strategic. I think they accelerate our ability to get into more markets. 
 And what I love is that they oftentimes are using our own existing developer platform, which means that they are just incredibly easy for us to integrate with the rest of Cloudflare and decrease the technical risk as we go with M&A. In all 3 of those cases, also, the founders and the team, they're just sort of Cloudflare-like people and they're people that we're so excited and proud to have on the team. And I think you'll hear more about the wins that we have from all those areas over the quarters to come. 
Thomas Blakey: Well, that would be great to get more high-margin SASE revenue here. And I'd like to go as a segue there, back to Brent's question on GPU, and I think he gave a great question about the unique architecture of the platform and this kind of multi-tenancy. But just seeing the explosive growth with other DSPs and the approach that folks are taking there, is it fair to characterize this way that CapEx would have to go up relatively significantly if, say, a handful of these applications is being built on your platform will explode to the like of something like a copilot? 
Matthew Prince: Well, I think that what I would look at is CapEx as a percentage of revenue. And I think one of the things that's always been magical about Cloudflare has been that we've been able to invest behind the demand, not ahead of the demand. And so we're really good at rolling out more capacity wherever we need it. And so that would be an amazing problem to have. If we have to -- we -- so it may be that we, on a just pure dollars basis, end up spending more on GPUs. But as a percentage of revenue, we feel very comfortable that we can service these applications very well at the percentage of revenues that it is in our forecast going forward. 
Thomas Seifert: What I would want to add here is we -- the efficiency of the architecture is really driving this. We talked about the revenue mix that allows us to invest into GPUs by more and more revenue driven by Zero Trust products. The efficiency that is driven in the hardware architecture is an additional factor that goes into this. We are in the rollout of what we call Generation 12 now of our service architecture. It's a little bit more than 25% total cost of ownership reduction in this new generation. So that is 25% more of CapEx we can deploy towards GPUs. So the levers are just not in one place, they are in many places, and the combination of this is really driving this incredible efficiency. 
Thomas Blakey: That's great. Well, maybe we'll look for you breaking out AI or gen AI revenue one of these days, Thomas. 
Thomas Seifert: As soon as it is the right thing to do. At the moment, I think we shouldn't get tired that the benefit in driving adoption is significantly more important than driving more revenue in the short term. This is why the efficiency is high is we see so many use cases from 2 million developers being on the platform. This far-sided approach has served us well, and we'll continue with it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson from Needham. 
Alex Henderson: Great. I wanted to ask a question about your comments about the macro conditions. About 2 years ago, I think, it was you guys gave an early warning that the economy had some risks to it and that you were seeing signs of slowdown. And that actually occurred 6, 9, 12 months later. And so with this commentary on this call, are you suggesting that you're seeing similar kind of characteristics to the conditions? Or is this just a little bit more noise to it, and therefore, you're being prudent, but you just don't have any visibility to whether that's going to happen yet? Can you contrast this event to several years ago when you gave that caution? 
Matthew Prince: Yes, Alex. So I -- 2 years ago, I felt like we had a pretty clear signal that the economy was slowing down. I would say that we don't have as clear of signal today that that's the case. We -- it's -- we see things that worry us, but we also see things that give us some level of optimism. And so I think describing the crystal ball as cloudy is the right thing. What I like though is that we have a crystal ball. We can make investments and we can think through what that future looks like, in part because we just get much more signal than I think the average enterprise SaaS company gets. And I think that, that has served us well. And I think we try not to be surprising in any way. And so as we see -- I would say that there is certainly an uptick in uncertainty and sort of potential downside this quarter over last quarter. But I would not characterize it as the same concerns that I had in Q1 of '20 -- what was that, '22 where we saw what we thought was much, much clearer. So we continue to watch this. Again, I feel like I am proud of how well Thomas and the rest of the team have the ability to take that and keep their hands on the levers of our business and continue to execute. But I'm not -- I think my level of concern is not at the same level that it was in Q1 of 2022, but it is definitely heightened over a lot of what we've seen in more recent quarters. 
Alex Henderson: So if nothing is really spooking you here, I'm still struggling with the guidance and the outlook for the back half of the year. You've given guidance that -- or commentary that you're seeing significant strengthening of your pipeline. You're saying your duration is stable. You're seeing solid closure rates. You're adding more sales capacity. You're winning large customer deals at an accelerating rate. You're spending more on hiring people and productivity. And your sales force is significantly improving. Yet your guidance implies with the first quarter beat and the second quarter are above the Street, the back half is much more conservative. So I guess the question is, is that a function of specific weakness in a particular geography or due to political issues? Or is it just trying to feather in more opportunity for the sales organization to be realigned as Mark comes on and drives things because ultimately, it sounds like the mechanics imply an acceleration not a deceleration. 
Matthew Prince: Yes. Alex, I'll start and then Thomas can give a little bit more color. I would push back on your initial statement, which was that nothing spooks me. A lot spooks me right now. So just because just -- and I want to make it clear, we are in a much more uncertain environment and the signal that we're seeing is that uncertainty is up. In addition to that, I think you're correct that whenever you have a sales leadership change, there is risk that comes with it. And so there's a bit of that. But the primary factor here is that as we look at the signals in the overall macro economy, it is -- it feels like a much more -- it feels like there's much more reason to worry in Q1 than there was in Q4. But that doesn't mean that it was the same, just sound the alarm bells that we were seeing back in Q1 of 2022. 
Alex Henderson: Great. So just essentially derisked it. I appreciate it. 
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. 
Timothy Horan: We saw the hyperscale cloud revenues really accelerate this quarter, the accelerated guidance. And they're actually talking about being kind of capacity constrained. And you're kind of the on-ramp on to those cloud guys. I guess why the disconnect between what they're seeing in guidance versus what you're seeing out there right now. Particularly, you're also in like the fastest-growing segments of serverless and low latency. But I guess what's changed other than your concerns on the macro or anything on the onramp thesis? 
Matthew Prince: Yes. I think that the big thing, Tim, that I'd point to is that they tend to be purely usage-based models. And the good of usage-based models is that they react very quickly, both up and down. And so I think whereas we tend to be much more of a subscription-based model, and the good of that is that it has a lot more stability. But -- and that stability helps you when things are slowing down. So we had significantly faster growth than the hyperscalers in the last few quarters, and we're now around where they are this quarter. And so I think we are a little bit more moderated than some of the more usage-based models. And I think that explains some of it. 
 I think the second thing that I'd add is that for some of the products, especially around the AI products, as Thomas said, we're really optimizing around adoption. And while we published pricing and that pricing was extremely well received, in addition to being very, very attractive for us from a margin perspective in the last months, that's something that is still not a place where we are heavily monetizing yet. But again, I think as I listed some of the examples, we see plenty of opportunity there. And we think that when we decide the time is right to turn on some of those monetization, it will help contribute to our top line growth. 
Timothy Horan: And just 2 quick follow-ups. Are you seeing any other competitors coming into what you offer on a global serverless, low-latency basis? And I guess you're implying, at some point, revenue growth should really accelerate here. I mean in a more stable macro environment or more visibility, I mean, everything we've been talking about on this call seems like, [ partners ] have said, incredibly positive. Do you -- and your guide for the second half, down to 26%, just seems like very, very low versus what it potentially could be. I guess do you think these steps will enable you to accelerate in the next couple of years? 
Matthew Prince: So on the competition front, we really don't. We think that we are in a very unique position. We don't see anybody else that is yet rolling out the type of connectivity cloud with true serverless architecture. There are people who are buying some legacy businesses. There are people who sort of talk a good game, but it turns out, when you pull the covers back, don't have very much business in this space at all. And so we are, I think, unique in the position that we're offering. 
 I don't think that will stay true forever. Other people will provide services here, but we have a clear lead. We have the richest ecosystem. And I think that what's great about Cloudflare's business is that we have existing, very stable businesses that continue to perform. We have newer businesses for us like our Zero Trust and SASE businesses, which are just accelerating up the S-curve. And then we have a lot of bleeding edge opportunity with things like our Workers' platform. And so Cloudflare is all about stacking S-curves, one behind another, behind another. And so where I think a lot of companies run out of TAM, run out of market, we are able to continue to add and innovate into new areas in a way that I think we'll achieve what we want, which is we think we're going to be one of the truly iconic technology companies and we're investing for that long term, including at times making the choice of optimizing for adoption rather than trying to figure out how we make money from every single customer with every single transaction. And we think that, that's the right formula for building what is an iconic technology company over the long term. 
Operator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Matthew Prince for some closing remarks. 
Matthew Prince: I just want to thank our entire team for executing. I know that in the world right now, there's a lot of scary things going on. There's a lot of tension, and what we do every day of making sure that the Internet continues to function, that it continues to be a force that drives the economy around the world going forward. I can't imagine anything more important to be working on. So thank you for the entire team for delivering yet another terrific quarter. We're getting back to work now, and we'll see you all again next quarter. Thank you.

2024,Q2,2024-08-01,"Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Kathleen, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Cloudfare Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Phil Winslow. Please go ahead.
Phil Winslow: Thank you for joining us today to discuss Cloudflare's financial results for the second quarter of 2024. With me on the call, we have Matthew Prince, Co-Founder and CEO; Michelle Zatlyn, Co-Founder, President and COO; and Thomas Seifert, CFO. By now, everyone should have access to our earnings announcement. This announcement, as well as our supplemental financial information may be found on our Investor Relations website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements during today's discussion, including but not limited to our customers, vendors and partners, operations and future financial performance, our anticipated product launches, and the timing and market potential of those products. Our anticipated future financial and operating performance and our expectations regarding future macroeconomic conditions. These statements and other comments are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, much of which is beyond our control. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any of our forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could impact our future operating results and financial condition, please see our filings with the SEC as well as in today's earnings press release. Unless otherwise noted, all numbers we talk about today, other than revenue, will be on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. You may find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that are included in our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. For historical periods, a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in the supplemental financial information referenced a few moments ago. We would also like to inform you that we will be participating in the Stifel Tech Executive Summit on August 26th and the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference on September 10th. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Matthew.
Matthew Prince: Thank you, Phil. We had a terrific quarter even with the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. We crossed $1.6 billion in annualized revenue, achieving $401 million in the second quarter, up 30% year-over-year. During the quarter, we added 168 new large customers, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year and now have 3,046 large customers, also up 30% year-over-year. Revenue contribution from these large customers during the quarter remained consistent at 67%, up from 64% in the second quarter last year. Our dollar based net retention was 112%, down 3 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. Our gross margin was 79%, again above our long-term target range of 75% to 77%. We delivered an operating profit of $57 million, representing an operating margin of 14.2%, underscoring our commitment to operational efficiency and productivity. We generated strong free cash flow of $38.3 million during the quarter, ahead of our expectations. This wasn't an easy quarter, but we continue to execute and deliver strong results. While I think we benefit from being a must-have, not a nice to have, we still had to fight for every deal as the IT-buying environment continues to be challenging. But our investments in go-to market improvements are showing dividends. Turns out when you have the right players on the field, you can still play and win even in the rain. In the second quarter, we again delivered another double-digit year-over-year improvement in sales productivity. In addition, close rates and sales cycles both also improved quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year. I'm proud of our team's execution. I also couldn't be more pleased about the early returns from Mark Anderson and the other go-to market leaders with proven track records who have joined the team. In Q2, Mark hired a new VP of Sales in the Americas, a new VP of Revenue and Operations and a Global Head of Customer Success. These are world class go-to market executives who recognize that we have the product, engineering and go-to market leadership for them to bet their careers. As Mark continues to focus on operationalizing productivity at scale and building a world class go-to market engine, a key focus in the second quarter involved making changes to the composition of our organization and bringing on more stage-appropriate talent. This really shows in the numbers. The sales manager and AE hiring in Q2 was up 150% quarter-over-quarter and 163% year-over-year. Again, the key to the quarter was excellent execution. We expect these additions to our go-to market team to further add to our already building momentum with large enterprise customers, partners, and the public sector that we again delivered during the second quarter. That's a great segue to discuss some of our wins in the quarter. A leading Australian technology company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a two-year $17.5 million contract, $7.2 million of which is expansion. They started with Cloudflare back in 2016 as a free customer and today use nearly all our products spanning use cases as diverse as remote application access, worker serverless development and bot management. Over the next two years, this customer expects to transmit over 180 petabytes and 3.9 trillion requests per month and they see Cloudflare as essential to handling that level of connectivity while maintaining security. This is a great example of a land and expand customer who started with our free tier, sees the value and expands over time. Sticking down under, another leading Australian technology company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a three-year $2.6 million contract for 18,000 seats of gateway, access, browser isolation, CASB, DLP and also our workers' development platform. This customer evaluated Cloudflare against three leading vendors in the market and selected us due to our superior technical solution, network performance and future roadmap. The customer called us after the deal closed and said, ""you were the best solution today, but also for the future and the most strategic. We're very excited for this."" One of the largest universities in the United States signed a five-year $5.7 million contract. This customer is going all in on Cloudflare's SASE platform with 20,000 seats of Zero Trust, CASB, DLP, email security, Magic WAN, and Magic Firewall. This university approached us looking to modernize and scale their global network as their incumbent on-premise solutions created bandwidth challenges and poor performance. With Cloudflare, they're able to replace multiple legacy vendors with a unified platform and cloud-first architecture. A large global research and development organization expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a two-year $846,000 contract for Cloudflare's SASE portfolio with 3,500 seats of access, gateway, CASB, DLP, browser isolation, and Magic WAN along with our advanced application security bundle. This was a very competitive process to displace legacy VPN providers and Cloudflare was selected over three SASE competitors due to our superior network performance, ease of use, and configuration as well as our unified platform. A Fortune 500 financial services company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one year $895,000 contract for Magic Transit and Magic Firewalls. Gaps in their incumbent products with two on-premise tenders left this customer vulnerable to attacks, creating significant urgency for our placement solution. A number of channel partners mentioned Cloudflare as a leader in DDoS to this customer, and we were quick to come in and get this customer fully deployed, operational, and protected in just 10 days. A Fortune 500 gaming company signed a two-year $3 million contract for advanced application security and performance along with R2 storage. This customer was looking to improve availability for its technical infrastructure to support its large global distribution of games. They are migrating all services from two incumbent vendors to Cloudflare through the completeness of our solution, our superior network performance and scale, and unified platform giving them a single control plane. A leading AI company signed a one-year $500,000 contract with Cloudflare to be their platform for AI for inference, storage, image optimization, and application security. This company with an existing R2 customer, allowing them to unlock the best prices and performance across multiple cloud providers. However, doing both training and inference with a centralized hyperscale cloud created poor performance for their end users. With Cloudflare, this customer now has access to GPUs deployed across our network, close to their end users. Not only will inference task be more performant, but this customer is also realizing a 40% cost improvement with Workers AI. A leading technology company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a two-year $4.8 million contract. This customer is focused on growing their enterprise and FedRAMP product lines and uses Cloudflare for Government along with Cloudflare Workers to dynamically route traffic in order to optimize reliability. This customer has significantly increased their usage as they unlock new use cases and lean further into standardizing on Cloudflare wherever possible across all their business units. After signing this deal, their team reached out to express interest in our AI products. So there should be more to come from this customer. I think there are two trends that stand out across all those customer stories. First, customers are adopting Cloudflare's broader platform and signing a pool of fun deals. That can have some revenue recognition and DNR impacts, but we believe it is actually an extremely healthy sign as when customers buy into our broad platform that we know of no competitors that can match our feature set. Second, you'll notice that more and more of these large deals include Cloudflare Workers, our developer platform. Last quarter, I announced that we crossed 2 million active developers on the platform. I checked in just the other day and we're already up to more than 2.4 million active developers and over 20% increase in just the last four months. This accelerated adoption following the announcements during our developer week in early April reinforces how developers are increasingly seeing Cloudflare as offering a complete solution for them to build and ship full-stack applications. Workers AI is growing even faster with developer accounts taking advantage of our AI functions increasing 67% quarter-over-quarter. Today, we have inference-tuned GPUs live in 167 cities worldwide, making us we believe the most global cloud inference solution and inference requests powered by Cloudflare AI increased more than 700% quarter-over-quarter. Developers are turning to Cloudflare for their AI tasks that need to be fast, global, and compliant with an increasing patchwork of AI regulations. There's external validation as well. Stacked overflow recently surveyed a broad base of developers on what platforms they're using today. Cloudflare came in fourth, just off the podium ahead of 22 other developer platforms and buying only the three traditional hyperscale public clouds. What's even more exciting, however, is what the survey tells us about the future. When developers were asked what platform, they were the most excited to work on in the coming year, Cloudflare came in second ahead of AWS, Google, and Microsoft Azure. Cloudflare didn't even make the survey in 2022, so we're coming out fast. If we continue to increase developer interest at the same rate, it won't be long before we meddle. And rest assured, our team won't be satisfied with anything short of gold. With that, I'll hand it off to Thomas, who looks after our gold to walk through our financial results. Thomas, take it away.
Thomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We are pleased with our execution during the second quarter as we make continuous progress on our go-to market transformation. We again delivered another double-digit year-over-year increase in sales productivity during the second quarter, and we also saw an uptick in close rates and an improvement in sales cycles. The quarter was highlighted by sustained momentum with large new customers, ongoing significant progress in the public sector, and continued high prioritization of security by our customers. Continuing our strong commitment to being fiscally responsible and acting as good stewards of investors' capital, operating profit again more than doubled year-over-year and we generated free cash flow of $38.3 million during the second quarter. Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the second quarter increased 30% year-over-year to $401 million. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 51% of revenue and increased 28% year-over-year. EMEA represented 28% of revenue and increased 32% year-over-year. APAC represented 13% of revenue and increased 29% year-over-year. We were pleased to see a notable uptick in both sequential and year-over-year growth in APAC as a number of go-to market initiatives in the region begin to deliver early returns. Turning to our customer metrics. In the second quarter, we had about 210,200 paying customers, an increase of 21% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with about 3,050 large customers, representing an increase of 30% year-over-year and an addition of 168 large customers in the quarter. Our dollar-based net retention rate was 112% during the second quarter, representing a decrease of 3 percentage points sequentially. The decline in DNR was driven by slower net expansion in our larger customer cohorts, increased platform deals in the form of pool of funds contracts, which reduce friction to adoption across our product portfolio, that can impact the shape of revenue recognition as well as deferred revenue and current RPO, especially for existing customers that transition into this structure and anniversary in the price increase to our Pro and business PayGo plans last year. For the next several quarters, we expect new customers to contribute a higher percentage of our overall year-over-year revenue growth, similar to the second quarter. Moving to gross margin. Second quarter gross margin was 79%, representing a decrease of 50 basis points sequentially and an increase of 130 basis points year-over-year. Network CapEx represented 6% of revenue in the second quarter. Based on the timing of certain investments, we expect network CapEx to increase in the second-half to reach 10% to 12% of revenue for full year 2024. Turning to operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 6% year-over-year to 65% as we remain committed to driving higher productivity and greater efficiency across our operations. Our total number of employees increased 15% year-over-year, bringing our total headcount to 3,902 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $149.5 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased 37% from 41% in the same quarter last year. This decline was primarily due to the transition of our go-to market organization to focus on more stage-appropriate talent. We are encouraged by the acceleration in account executive hiring exiting the second quarter, which Matthew mentioned earlier, and we expect this trend to continue in the second-half of 2024. Research and development expenses were $65.4 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue decreased to 16% from 17% in the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $44.7 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 11% from 13% in the same quarter last year. Operating income was $57 million compared to $20.3 million in the same period last year. Second quarter operating margin was 14.2%, an increase of 760 basis points year-over-year. These results highlight our continued focus on becoming more efficient and more productive, given that operational excellence is a long-term competitive advantage. Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $69.5 million or dilutive net income per share of $0.20. We ended the second quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $38.3 million in the second quarter or 10% of revenue compared to $20 million or 6% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations or RPO came in at $1,421 million, representing an increase of 6% sequentially or 37% year-over-year. Current RPO was 69% of total RPO. Moving to guidance for the third quarter and full year 2024. We are pleased with our execution during the second quarter, and we remain prudent in our outlook for 2024. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $423 million to $424 million, representing an increase of 26% year-over-year. We expect operating income in the range of $50 million to $51 million and we expect an effective tax rate of 11%. We expect diluted net income per share of $0.18, assuming approximately 359 million shares outstanding. For the full year 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $1,657 million to $1,659 million, representing an increase of 28% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $196 million to $198 million. We expect an effective tax rate of 11% for 2024. We expect diluted net income per share over that period to be $0.70 to $0.71, assuming approximately 358 million shares outstanding. We are currently analyzing our ability to implement certain tax planning strategies in order to manage current and future cash tax liabilities. We will provide an update once this tax planning review is completed if the outcome were to impact our expectations for Cloudflare's non-GAAP effective tax rate in the second-half of 2024. We expect free cash flow to be consistent with our implied prior guidance of approximately $160 million to $164 million for the full-year 2024. In closing, our team remains committed to driving operational excellence, ensuring long-term growth, and delivering significant shareholder value. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication to our mission as well as our customers for trusting us to help them modernize, transform, and secure their businesses. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Matt Hedberg: Great. Thank you very much, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Obviously, this is a challenging environment and to see the consistency, it's really, really great. Matthew, maybe to start with you. It was great to see another quarter of double-digit sales productivity improvements. I guess, what are some of the most important changes Mark Anderson and I guess the broader team is implementing to drive that result? And given that you said macros remain challenging, is increased productivity also help the cause of really accelerated sales cycles and improved close rates?
Matthew Prince: Yes. Thanks, Matt. I think we've tried to be very transparent about what we were seeing. I think the real nadir for us in sales productivity was in Q3 of 2023. And then this quarter, we're back to the same sales productivity that we saw back in mid-2022. So we're -- it is rebounding well. I think Mark Anderson gets a lot of credit for that over the last bit, but the real changes started even before Mark joined us. And I think we're starting to -- we're already seeing the benefits of the changes of just really putting in place much better operational metrics, putting in place much better training, really upleveling our team, having the discipline to do performance management and then -- and then have that flow through. And I think that's a lot of what you're seeing today. What Mark is doing is accelerating that even more. And that starts with hiring really excellent lieutenants and really excellent leaders. It's a dramatic upgrade across our entire sales organization. And then what's been just amazing to watch is great people want to follow great people. And so Mark has a huge number of amazing people who want to follow him. Those people who follow him now are bringing in and upleveling our team. And what we're seeing is not only are they more productive, but then they're helping our existing team who are really amazing people get more productive as well. So I think discipline, execution, that started before Mark Anderson. I think it's accelerating with Mark Anderson. And we have never had a product problem. We've never had a demand problem that's here. And what every sales leader who comes in says is, I just can't wait to roll up my sleeves, put in place the real discipline, and get out to selling what is an incredible product.
Matt Hedberg: That's great. It sounds like a real flywheel effect. And maybe just a quick one for Thomas. In your prepared remarks, you noted that DNR ticked down three points sequentially. And obviously, this is a trailing 12-month metric, and you called out a number of factors that negatively impacted that metric. I guess the fact that you raised full-year revenue guidance more than the Q2 beat, does that imply DNR has bottomed, or could it see some further pressure given that you noted a larger percentage of revenue growth will come from new customers in the future?
Thomas Seifert: Yes. So as we said in my prepared remarks, the decrease was driven by solar net expansion, but it was also impacted by what Matthew described, a large pool of funds deals. So as we enter this fiscal year, we've entered into several of these pool of fund deals. They're all very large in nature, the biggest ones, anywhere between $40 million to $60 million of total contract value. As a matter of fact, four of our top 10 customers are now pool of funds customers. And these pools of fund deals are generally built monthly as compared to an upfront annual billing and they tend to have longer duration. So most of these contracts are north of three years. And as a result, the financial impact of these pool of fund deals is very different. It's very different on revenue and it's different on current RPO and it's very different on deferred revenue. And if it's an existing customer that transitions, it also impacts DNR. And so as it relates to revenue, the revenue is now recognized as the customer consumes the service. And as a result, the record revenue recognition might be non-linear and might ramp over time with respect to deferred revenue because those deals have monthly billing terms, we do not report upfront deferred revenue, and this can result then in lower deferred revenue growth. And then current RPO is also impacted because the contract duration is longer. So you recognize upfront less in current RPO. So while the deals are very beneficial and healthy to the business, and they generate some noise in this transition in our DNR and in the other metrics. So very healthy trends, will make the business a little bit more lumpy. And as of last year, I still think those KPIs are the right KPIs, but I think you have to look at them more from a rolling and average perspective but very healthy development, very large deals, but with some noise and lumpiness in the transition.
Matt Hedberg: Super helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Shaul Eyal: Thank you. Good afternoon and congrats on results in what appears to be a swift action by Mark and the entire team. Matthew, given the recent CrowdStrike ID outage, which was on-premise predominantly. My question is whether Cloudflare was called by some customers to assist given your cloud connectivity capabilities and focus and whether you could be seeing some longer-term benefit given this focus? And I have a follow-up.
Mark Anderson: Yes, Shaul. I think we get called to help customers all the time, but we don't have a product that directly competes or replaces CrowdStrike. I think the first thing I'd say is that our whole team, we offered to help CrowdStrike directly in any way that we could, helping them get patches out or leases out, helping review any communications that they had. And they have been a great partner. We are a customer of theirs and we continue to have faith in their product and George and the rest of his leadership team. I think more generally though, the word of the day is going to be resilience, which is that customers are going to want to make sure that they are not sole-sourced on any one vendor and that includes with vendors like the ones that are providing network security like we do at Cloudflare. And so when we're talking to large financial institutions, what they're saying to us is, we want to use you and someone else. That I think is going to put pressure on some of the older, more legacy providers. I think for us, it actually is potentially tailwind for us because in places where before we had to convince someone to rip and replace, now instead, we just have to say you need to have a second provider in place. And since we have been the disruptor in the market moving from the low-end up and increasingly going into larger enterprises. I think it actually opens up more and more opportunity for us over time. So what I'm hearing from customers is that resilience is key that people are increasingly not wanting to be entirely reliant on any one vendor. And I think that especially in the larger accounts that we're going after, that is actually going to open up an opportunity for us to get in because it means we can sit side-by-side with someone else. What's great though is our performance is better, our security is better and we know time and time and time again if you put us next to anyone else in the CASB space, anybody else in the SASE space, anyone else that these vendors are looking at, we may start out as the number two vendor, but very quickly, they realize that we should be number one.
Shaul Eyal: Understood. And I was listening carefully to your prepared remarks as it relates to the product, seems as if you're hitting on all cylinders Magic Translate, Virtual Firewall, SASE workers, RTU, you name it. But the question is whether there was any specific one or two product services that stood out specifically this quarter?
Matthew Prince: I think the first thing I'd say is that -- and this really echoes what Thomas was just talking about, when we say that people are signing up for pool of funds deals, what they are really signing up for is to use the entire Cloudflare platform. And so more and more, we're seeing that people are saying, I'm not picking you for one feature or another. I'm picking it because the entire platform gives me a solution to all of my network performance, security, and reliability needs. And so I think that that's what's driving a lot of our larger deals with our larger customers. And I think that's an incredibly encouraging result. If you force me to pick one area that's really standing out, it's got to be the developer platform. I was blown away that just quarter-over-quarter, we've seen a 20% increase in active developer accounts. That is especially showing up in the Workers AI platform, we've been able to partner with folks like Meta to be able to get the latest versions of Lama out on our platform and developers are just flocking to it. And so I think that if you look around in our developer channels, our discord channel, if you look around on Twitter, you'll see that more and more developers are betting the future of whatever their application is on the Workers platform and they found that they can use us and us alone to build future applications, which again, every day I get a new report from our team just saying you won't believe what somebody built on Cloudflare Workers. So if you force me to pick one thing, I'm going to say Workers was the real standout of the quarter, but generally, it's been the platform.
Shaul Eyal: Thank you. Well done.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Fish of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Jim Fish: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions here. Look, I know it's not a metric you guys completely focused in on, but it was the largest net customer additions I think you guys have had as a public company in aggregate. And so Matthew, you've had a phenomenal track-record of really calling out IT spending trends and you did say some tightness still. And so my question really is, how are customers balancing this tightness with sort of that potential total cost of ownership savings by moving on to a Cloudflare versus kind of new projects? And how are you kind of thinking this could change in terms of IT spending, if at all in the second-half as budgets begin to be set later this year for next year actually?
Matthew Prince: Yes. Maybe I'll start and then Thomas might have something else to add. So I do think that it continues to be a challenging IT-buying environment, and this was by no means an easy quarter. I'm proud of our team and execution was really, really the name of the game here. And I think that, that increased execution will pay dividends even as the IT environment inevitably does rebound over time. But that -- our crystal ball still shows that it's challenging sledding for the overall IT environment over the quarters ahead. I do think that we benefit by being something that companies must have. While IT budgets might be getting cut in marketing tech, in productivity tech and in other spaces. I think security is one of the areas and we've had so many high-profile security incidents over the first-half of this year. The security is an area where people are continuing to invest. But what I think is really powerful about Cloudflare is we don't just solve one security need. We solve the totality of a customer's security needs. And so oftentimes, when a customer is signing one of these pool of fund deals, they're replacing two, three, four different vendors and consolidating behind Cloudflare. And so I think that what we see over time is that the network security space is the area that we want to own soup to nuts and that we can completely have that as a solution for customers. And in times where IT budgets are tough, that is a place where people want to consolidate. They want to consolidate on a single vendor, and we are a beneficiary of that.
Thomas Seifert: Can you guys -- quick?
Jim Fish: Go ahead, Thomas.
Thomas Seifert: Yes. I just wanted to add to your introduction, but it was a very strong net customer at quarter and mainly driven by three effects. So we had a one-time benefit because we migrated billing platforms and there was a catch up. But beyond that one-time benefit, it was a very strong net customer at quarter driven by our two-customer increase, up 32% at quarter-over-quarter in the second quarter, as well as the increase in developers on their Workers platform that Matthew talked about. So those three factors were driving the comp. So very strong quarter.
Jim Fish: Makes sense. And you guys obviously pool of funds is another theme of this quarter. And Thomas, you had just said a few moments ago, I believe that it was 4 of the top 10 customers are now on this type of contract. So is there a way to understand how much of RPO is now on this sort of pool of funds path as even just those four at that kind of 50-ish million average rate would imply about 15% of RPO today? And additionally, what could that look like kind of a few years down the road?
Thomas Seifert: Well, I will not give you that kind of information. But what you just said, I think is a good indication. We've always been asked how we drive customer revenue up and how you can get to $3 digit million ACVs and TCVs. Pool of funds will be that path and then Matthew outlined the reasons for that. In addition to the pool of fund deals and in the second quarter, we also entered into a handful of very large subscription arrangements, all well north of $5 million. And those are more predictable from a revenue recognition and forecasting perspective, but they have very similar impacts on RPO and deferred revenue. So in addition to the pool of fund structure impacting us generating this lumpiness in the quarter, and we were also successful signing very large subscription arrangements in the second quarter too.
Jim Fish: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Andrew Nowinski: Okay, good afternoon. Congrats on another amazing quarter. So I wanted to ask a bit of a techy question to start here as it relates to your Edge AI and your OHTTP offering. Now, I know you're one of the co-founders of OHTP, but I was wondering if you could comment on how your customers might be using it as a way to preserve data privacy and maybe give us an idea on the revenue opportunity there?
Matthew Prince: Sure. And this might -- I'm not sure how to do this and not make it a little bit geeky. But OHTTP, the original sin of the Cloud -- the original sin of the Internet is that your IP -- forget cookies, forget anything else, your IP address alone reveals a ton about who you are, where you are, and a bunch -- and a bunch of other things. Your IP address in your home, for instance, doesn't change all that often. And so even without cookies, even without anything else, people can build profiles of you. As privacy has become more and more important as we -- as -- and then recognized as being more and more important online. I think one of the things that our team with a number of other industry partners and leaders has really focused on is how can we eliminate that original sin, how can we disassociate your IP address from your identity. And so OHTTP is a technology that does it. The best way to think about it's essentially two hops in the system. So if your device connects to the first proxy that is out there, that proxy knows what device connected to it. But then it can use encryption to wrap that identity piece up almost like putting it in an envelope and handing it off to a second proxy and that second proxy is the only thing that knows where that traffic is going. So one party can know who is behind something and the other party can know where they're going, but neither party knows both where any one individual is going. So you can imagine in the case of like a handset manufacturer, they may operate that first proxy because they operate the handsets themselves, but then hand that off to a third-party like Cloudflare in order to never have the information about where their customers go online. I think that what's interesting about this is that the very nature of the protocol requires an independent third-party. So at no point can the handset manufacturers say we're going to complete the soup to nuts. They have to have an independent third-party. And the third-party of choice in this, I think in large part because privacy has been so core to who Cloudflare is and what we do. It's one of our five core values in terms of when we think about products. And because of just our breadth and technical expertise, as more and more companies are thinking about this and recognizing that both for philosophical reasons, but then also for regulatory reasons that they need to be as private as possible, Cloudflare is that preferred place to be that second hop in an OHTTP solution. So I have been -- I think we built this for some very specific and I would have thought relatively limited use cases. I am surprised how many different use cases this is now getting introduced into. And I think that as AI continues to develop, it's an area where a lot of people are rethinking the privacy of the Internet and thinking about how can they incorporate more modern standards. And to that extent, I think you will see that if there is continued growth in this space, it actually may be a lot of the AI companies that are leading in that direction.
Andrew Nowinski: Great. Thank you. That was really helpful. Maybe a question for Thomas as well, just really impressive operating leverage in the model and a strong guide for the year. I know you're not giving fiscal '25 guidance yet, but given the substantial raise to your operating margin for this year, I was wondering if you could at least tell us how you're thinking about operating leverage next year and whether you'd expect operating margin expansion above the new guidance you gave for this year? Thanks.
Thomas Seifert: Yes, nice try, but I'm not going to give guidance for next year. But I think over the years, we have been good stewards of investors' capital, and this will continue. And we, Matthew and Michelle described how the philosophy -- how we run the business really well in this long -- as we see a market that is this large in terms of TAM that we can disrupt and deliver strong growth rates, investment into Cloudflare is the best return for the money that we earn. And keeping this balance in terms of how we think about the business of growth rate and operating leverage, I think served us well and we'll continue, will not deviate from this philosophy in next year, but I will shy away from giving you guidance.
Andrew Nowinski: Okay, thanks. Keep up the good work, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Borg of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Adam Borg: Awesome, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just building off the last question a little bit and even tying it back to some of the wins you talked earlier on AI. How do you think about the inference opportunity overall when you think about hyperscale clouds, obviously, the Edge network that you've built as well as the Edge device themselves, how do you think about how that relationship looks like today and how that evolves over time?
Matthew Prince: Yes, Adam, my take is that inference is primarily going to happen in two places. The first is on devices themselves. And that you can already see what a number of handset manufacturers and others are doing to bring more powerful GPUs and TPUs directly to devices. And my rough hand wavy, I have no idea if it will be right, but just as a mental model is that maybe 50% of inference tasks get handled on your device. But there will always be either devices which are older and maybe don't have the latest chips on them or models that are bigger and require more compute power than your handheld or device is able to deliver. And in those cases, you're going to hand that inference task off to something else. One model of that is to send that back to Ashburn, Virginia, or some centralized sort of traditional public cloud. I think that, especially because of the concerns around privacy, because of the regulatory concerns where AI is getting just rapidly regulated that you're going to want to keep that as close as possible. That also has the benefit of making it as performant as possible. And it also means that you can have the AI that's responding, have regional differences more easily so that if you're responding in the UK and the NAI can spell color with a U, whereas if it's in the U.S., it can spell it with no U. I think all of those things then drive a lot of the other 50% of inference tasks to be running at a network like Cloudflare. And so we are trying to build that network out ahead, make sure that we can answer any inference task that can't get determined on your own device as close as possible to that device, and then make it very easy to get that inference task from us or from the device to us in a standards based API-driven way so that is seamless to that end user. There will still be some tasks that maybe will be even too big to run at us, although that is becoming a smaller and smaller list of tasks and maybe there's some small percent that makes its way back to a traditional hyperscale public cloud. But I really think that inference is going to be between the end devices themselves and a network that is like Cloudflare that spans the globe and is incredibly close in every jurisdiction where end users might be.
Adam Borg: Awesome. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani of Citi. Please go ahead.
Fatima Boolani: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Matthew and Thomas, this is for you both. I had a bigger picture question around the pricing strategy across the portfolio. So at a tactical level, you had some meaningful price increases that -- your first ones ever. Thomas, wondering if you could just opine on how far deep those have pervaded the installed base and if you can kind of talk to where we are in terms of the innings, in terms of how that unfurled in the base? And then, Matthew , the bigger picture question for you is if I piece together a lot of what you shared in the prepared remarks as it relates to pool of fund deals, more pay-as-you-go, more consumption payment modalities, especially as the Workers portfolio scales, how should we generally think about the business impact and sort of revenue elasticity, if you will? Thank you.
Matthew Prince: I'll start and then Thomas can add. And I think we might both have something to say on both pieces. So we're about a year after a price increase across our pay-as-you-go business. That is a -- it's an important part of our business, but it is a relatively small part of our business. I think we -- for a long-time we're very reluctant to raise prices on that part of the business, but we had added so much value that we just thought that it was the right thing to do. And we were really incredibly pleasantly surprised how many of the customers, the pay-as-you-go customers not only didn't -- turn rates were tiny, due to that price increase but really -- actually wrote to us and said about time because there's so much more value that you've added. And that was -- it was good. Price increases didn't apply across the rest of the platform. So enterprise customers, all the customers we talked about on these calls, there wasn't any dramatic price increase there. I think we are always trying to find ways to have the highest ROI for our large customers. And typically, we can be a substantial saving over whatever the existing vendors are in the market. And because we have the efficiency in our business, we can do that while still maintaining 78%, 79% gross margins. Our long-term target gross margins are 75% to 77% and we've been coming in ahead of that. And again, very healthy software-like gross margins even for our business with the operational complexity and intensity that we have. And I think that's what allowed us to be -- to deliver the returns that we can. Generally, I think philosophically, what we want to do is be the network for all of our customers and we want to solve all of the problems that a customer has around their network. And so we think of it as being their connectivity cloud and that connectivity cloud works great with whatever devices and things they have on-premise, works great with whatever they're running in a traditional hyperscale public cloud, but we're that connectivity layer that sits between those things. And that's a very, very, very substantial opportunity. And one that I think we have only just started to really, really penetrate.
Fatima Boolani: I appreciate that.
Thomas Seifert: There's not much to add to what Matthew just said. Some of the impacts of this transition you have seen, we talked about how pool of funds deal impacts the lumpiness or make our numbers a little bit more lumpy and we will also have an increasingly higher share of variable revenue in our numbers, while this number is still small today, it will grow meaningful over time. But this is less driven by price increases as Matthew said, but it's more driven by the structural changes that this transition implies and with all the overall benefits of more stickiness, longer duration deals, platform deals with better expansion capability and significantly higher total contract values.
Fatima Boolani: Thank you for the color.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Hamza Fodderwala: All right. Good evening. Thank you for taking my questions. Matthew, I just had one question on public sector for you. We saw a lot of strong momentum in the public sector space and the federal space over the last year. I'm curious, as we head into the federal fiscal year close, in September, what that momentum has been like, especially ahead of what's going to be an election in November? What are you hearing from the agency customers that you work with? Thank you.
Matthew Prince: Yes. So federal has been a real point of strength for us ever since we started investing in it. And ever since we achieved FedRAMP certification, which really unlocked a lot of U.S. federal business, but we've seen also strong government business around the world. I would say first of all, the election is incredibly important. We couldn't have built Cloudflare without a stable functioning democracy and you can't have stable functioning democracies unless you have elections that people can trust. And so since 2016, actually directly in response to the -- a lot of mistrust and tampering in the 2016 election, we launched what we call the Athenian project where we provide our services at no cost to anyone who is helping administer an election around the world and in -- or excuse me, around the United States, although we've increasingly started doing it in select countries around the world as well. And I'm incredibly proud of the work that we do on this to help support what are largely unsung heroes, I don't care if it's a red state or a blue state or a purple state, like if you're helping administer an election in some county around the United States, you're a real patriot and a real hero and you need all the help and protection that we can give. And I'm proud of the fact that our team on a pro bono basis provides the full suite of our services to the people who are administering elections because I think it's fundamental for the success of our country and our country is fundamental to the success of the company. So I'm not sure that the election itself drives significant upticks in spending. And I feel kind of a little gross if it did because I think it's our duty to provide our services in these cases. What I will say is that I think most of the people who are listening in on this call would say that it's not always the most rational thing to go work for government, certainly doesn't pay the best that's out there. But I think what government -- with government officials that I've talked to, the public servants that I've talked to, again, across the political spectrum, what they all are is very mission-driven and they believe in the mission of -- in the United States of this country and the importance of that. And I think that they very much respect when they see companies like Cloudflare step up and say, it's not just all about how we collect the most revenue, but it's how we do the right thing to protect the underlying function of democracy. And so when you hear about us winning big deals that are big numbers and large revenue producing deals, I think a lot of that comes from the fact that we are thought of extremely well by those incredibly patriotic, very mission-driven people who are public servants. And when they're thinking about when they have a hard problem that they are going to pick a vendor for, who they turn to, the work that we do on things like the Athenian project and protecting elections is part of why we've had the momentum and the success that we've had with the federal business. And I think that will continue and only accelerate over the quarters and years to come.
Hamza Fodderwala: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Trevor Walsh of JMP. Please go ahead.
Trevor Walsh: Great. Hi, team. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one question for me, but I need a couple of parts. Matthew, you had a good win story that you had in your prepared remarks, I think it was with the Australian tech company SASE deal where they had also purchased Workers. Curious how much you're leaning into those SASE deals where an Act 3 product such as Workers is kind of coming into the fold and how kind of important of a differentiator you see that within that particular market? And then as a follow-up, you had your descaler campaign last year to kind of handle or campaign against one particular competitor in that space. Just curious if you're seeing that overall competitive landscape shift at all kind of in the last 12 months and if we might see a similar campaign against another competitor there? Just maybe just get your overall thoughts about who you're seeing in the deals and if there's other players kind of coming up from different parts of the market that are not the standard ones that you've come up in the past? Thanks.
Matthew Prince: Yes. I think that the thing that we can do that's very difficult for any point solution vendor to compete with is to provide a comprehensive solution. And so you -- again, if the theme is pool of funds, platform deals, broad deals, Workers is a part of that. It is quite not as big of a part as our traditional application security. If you -- it doesn't make any sense if you're going to do a SASE deal to not have the same vendor also providing your DDoS mitigation and we're really the only vendor in the space that can do both the traffic coming into your network and the traffic going out from your network. But it's just a network, like the network should be smart, and that should be -- you should provide one kind of holistic solution. I don't know yet of any real vendors where people have said, oh, I'm or any real customers where people have said, I'm going to choose your SASE solution because of Workers. There are places where people are using Workers and then they use our SASE solution, and those things go together. But I think you'll start to see more of that going forward. The really powerful thing comes back to sort of the origin story of Workers itself. We didn't build Workers to sell it as a developer platform. We built it because we saw all of these opportunities and we needed to develop a platform for our internal team, customer zero to be able to build different solutions. What's powerful about that is that -- that then means that same platform can be used to adapt, configure, or customize any of the solutions that are built on Workers, more so than you can with any other vendor that's out there because you're using that same developer platform. I don't think that's -- I don't think we're there yet in terms of customers. I think we're still in the kind of just get it up and running stage. And not just us, I think across the entire space, SASE is a new enough category. But over time, I think when people go from saying, first of all, I want to secure network. Secondly, I want to make sure it's reliable. Third, I want to make sure that it is fast, it's performant. I think the next thing that people come to is, I want to make sure it's programmable. I think we are still kind of in the secure and reliable stage. I think customers are coming to us away from some of the first-generation Zero-Trust and SASE vendors because we are secure, reliable, and fast. But over time, secure, reliable, fast, and programmable is a pretty killer combination that I don't think there's any other vendor out there that's going to be able to match.
Trevor Walsh: Great. I appreciate the perspective. Thanks.
Operator: That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Matthew Prince for closing remarks.
Matthew Prince: Just wanted to say thank you to the entire Cloudflare team. This quarter really the theme was execution and you guys executed incredibly well. Thank you to the team. Thank you to all of our customers. It continues to be a complicated world out there, but Cloudflare is helping better secure networks everywhere around the world. Thank you all. See you back here next quarter.

We would also like to inform you that we will be participating in the RBC Capital Markets Global PIMC Conference on November 20th and the Wells Fargo 8th Annual TMC Summit on December 4th. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Matt.
Matthew Prince: Thank you, Phil. We are pleased with our results for the third quarter, exceeding expectations for revenue, operating margin, and free cash flow while also reaching what I believe is a critical inflection point in our rebuild of our go-to-market organization. During the third quarter, we achieved revenue of $430.1 million, up 28% year-over-year. We added a record 219 new large customers, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year, and now have 3,265 large customers up 28% year-over-year. We also achieved a new milestone of counting 35% of the Fortune 500 as paying Cloudflare customers. Revenue contribution from large customers during the quarter remained consistent at 67% up from 65% in the third quarter last year. Our dollar-based net retention was 110%, down 2 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. While customer churn remains consistently low, our shift to more pool of funds deals with our largest customers, which represented nearly 10% of new ACV booked in the quarter, up from 1% a year ago has put downward pressure on dollar-based net retention and changed the shape of revenue recognition in the short term. Over the long term, however, we believe pool of fund deals are very positive for the business as they represent our largest customers making a broad commitment to Cloudflare's overall platform. Our gross margin was 78.8%, remaining above our long-term target range of 75% to 77%, and up a tad from 78.7% in the same quarter last year. We delivered an operating profit of $63.5 million, representing an operating margin of 14.8%. Our continued strength in operating margin underscores our commitment to operational efficiency and productivity. Free cash flow came in at $45.3 million, ahead of expectations even as we are investing in our network and enhance capabilities like faster, more capable GPUs around the world. In Q3, the IT spending environment remained consistent with prior quarters with customers closely scrutinizing every deal, emphasizing cost efficiency and seeking meaningful ROI. This cautious approach isn't new, it's something we understand and they must have, not a nice to have benefit from relative to some of our peers. Moreover, our broad platform has allowed us to sell multiple problems for customers from a single vendor, giving us an advantage over many of our point solution competitors. However, some larger deals slipped out of the quarter in the U.S. in particular, during what was a transitional period under new sales leadership in that region. These deals are still active in our pipeline with many having already closed this quarter. Although changes in our sales force may have impacted the short-term cadence of some larger deal cycles. What stood out to me is that the third quarter felt like we hit the inflection point in the rebuild of our go-to-market team. Mark Anderson has lived up to being a world-class sales leader he hired stage appropriate talent across our go-to-market organization than fair but relentless of performance management and brought disciplined focus to our team. That's showing in the numbers. Our sales productivity has continued to improve and is now back around the best levels we saw in 2022. Mark believes there's still significant headroom above where we are as we focus not on batting average, but on slugging percentage, shifting more of our account executives to enterprise sales with higher quotas and the ability to sell bigger deals. As we've worked through performance management and up-leveling the team, our ramp rep capacity has been essentially flat for the last four quarters. When I said we've hit an inflection point, this is the biggest thing that I'm watching. Starting in 2025, we expect the number of ramped reps will begin to increase meaningfully again, but with a shift towards more real sluggers who can bring in more enterprise deals. To make it tangible, nearly 70% of new sales hires this year are in the Enterprise segment compared with 40% on average over the prior two years. As you may recall from Mark's presentation at Investor Day earlier this year, momentum in ACV growth is a product of sales capacity times productivity. We've made all of improvements in productivity. Now we're about to start to see the capacity of our sales force reaccelerate. I'm excited to be coming out the other side of our go-to-market transformation, and we expect these initiatives will deliver improving ACV momentum in the coming quarters. As I've shared with some of you, if I think about the last 15 years at Cloudflare, there's always something that I'm worried about, something that's broken or as Michelle would say, an opportunity to improve. It's always tended to be one of three things; sales, stability or shipping. I picture it serves like a hockey puck sliding around points in a triangle etched in the ice. You get good at selling a product to more demanding customers buy it. that causes whatever level of service that was acceptable before to no longer be acceptable to you focus on improving stability. And as you have demanding customers and have put in place better systems and processes to ensure stability, it starts to hamstring your ability to ship new products. At some level, my job is to live [indiscernible] so I started to worry about go-to-market a few years ago. About a year ago, it became clear that we were going to be able to bring on Mark Anderson and meaningfully up-level vaccine. Right on queue, as I stopped worrying about go-to-market, we suffered the stability in sense of last year. We focus on things and we fix them. And today, our stability, even with our broad products and more demanding customers is world-class. So I was gearing up to start worrying about shipping when ahead of schedule, I got introduced to CJ Desai, one of the most proven product and engineering leaders who is now our Chief Product and Engineering Officer. The team knows how to shift. So now I find myself in the strange position of having to look for new things to worry about in the medium term. Undoubtedly, given our ambition, we'll find new challenges, but I imparted that incredible leaders like Mark Anderson, CJ Desai, Stephanie Cohen, all of whom had incredible offers to be CEOs and other organizations believe in Cloudflare's mission and the opportunity we have to build the next iconic technology company to turn down those other offers and join our team over the last year. With that, let me turn to some customer wins in the quarter. A rapidly growing AI company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one year $7 million pool of funds contracts for Workers AI. This company signed a $500,000 contract in Q2 for Cloudflare to be their platform for AI for inference, storage, image optimization and application security. They quickly recognize the value of our platform and are now moving all of their workloads over to make Cloudflare their single inference cloud platform. With Workers AI, this customer is able to improve cost efficiency with our paper inference model and also eliminate the need for a dedicated team to run and manage their infrastructure. Realizing a nearly 2 times performance improvement over traditional public clouds with Workers AI was just the cherry on top. This win is just the beginning for Workers AI. A rapidly growing technology company signed a 3.5-year $2.4 million contract for R2, Workers and Application Security. Key concerns for this customer were high egress fees, unpredictable cost spikes and vendor lock-in with a hyperscale public cloud provider, and they viewed R2 as a strategic tool to allow them to unlock paths to realize the full benefits of the cloud with cloud. With Cloudflare's Workers, R2 and Application Services all on one platform, this customer was able to increase their global application performance by 3.5x and drive down their TCO. This customer is also working closely with our product team on some exciting new developments around Workers AI. A rapidly growing operator of a large satellite Internet constellation signed a three year $4 million pool of funds contract for our full suite of FedRAMP products. Given the importance of security, performance and data sovereignty in this industry, this customer quickly looked to Cloudflare to become a strategic partner that can help them build and operationalize their design and network long term. A Fortune 100 technology company signed a two year $4.2 million contract. This customer sought resiliency on their most critical dynamic traffic, which was previously only routed through a centralized hyperscaler. With CloudFlare, they were not only able to gain greater resiliency, but also realize better performance and more robust security capabilities. We continue to see resiliency emerged as a key theme, enabling Cloudflare to establish a beachhead inside large enterprise accounts alongside incumbent providers. A Global 2000 manufacturing company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare signing a three year $2.4 million contract for 45,000 Zero trustees, along with Magic WAN and Magic Firewall to provide secure access to more than 600 offices. Their multi-vendor incumbent architecture with a first-generation Zero Trust competitor and other on-premise vendors led to gaps in security and a lack of visibility. After evaluating several vendors, Cloudflare demonstrated a superior technical solution to their 200 use cases in addition to increasing their security posture and consolidating multiple point solutions onto a unified SaaS platform. In the words of the customer, Cloudflare's a Swiss Army knife, we can do so many things. A large technology company in Europe, expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one year $5.3 million contract for more than 40,000 seats of access gateway data loss prevention, along with remote grower isolation, workers and application security. With the company looking to not only enhance its security posture but also consolidate onto one platform, our innovative Zero Trust road map was a key differentiator. In the words of the customer, we are an engineering-driven company. We build most of our tech so we want something modern, effective and secure. Finally, I wanted to congratulate President Trump on his election victory and I'll also recognize Vice President, Harris for a hard-fought campaign. Both candidates were Cloudflare customers. Both were targeted by cyberattacks and I'm proud that we were able to defend them both without incident. I'm even more proud of something else. More than half of U.S. states and most of the so-called battleground states rely on Cloudflare's Athenian project where we provide free service to any official administering elections, whether they're in red, blue or purple states. We couldn't have built Cloudflare without a stable functioning political system. And key to that is making sure that you can trust the democratic process. I wanted to thank our team who've been on call for the last several months and especially over the last few weeks to come to the aid of election officials and campaigns whenever they've had a need. There will be lots of stories from the 2024 presidential election that cyberattacks won't be a meaningful part of any of them, and I'm proud that Cloudflare is part of the reason why. With that, I'll turn it over to Thomas. Thomas, take it away.
Thomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We are pleased with our execution during the third quarter as we made further progress on our go-to-market transformation delivering another double-digit year-over-year improvement in sales productivity. However, sales cycles leased during the quarter and some larger deals slipped out of the quarter in the U.S., in particular, Importantly, these are still active deals. As Matthew mentioned earlier, the third quarter marked a key inflection point in our go-to-market transformation with net sales capacity having bottomed. Similar to last quarter, we continued to increase hiring in our sales organization with a particular focus on onboarding enterprise account executives with proven track records. We expect the number of brands enterprise account executives to accelerate exiting 2024 and throughout 2025, and this is particularly the case in the U.S. Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 28% year-over-year to $430.1 million. The third quarter was highlighted by ongoing strength in pool or fund contract momentum with Wake and continued high prioritization of security by our customers. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 50% of revenue and increased 22% year-over-year. EMEA represented 28% of revenue and increased 31% year-over-year. APAC represented 14% of revenue, an increase of 38% year-over-year. We were again pleased to see a notable uptick in both sequential and year-over-year growth in APAC. Turning to our customer metrics. In the third quarter, we had about 221,500 paying customers, an increase of 22% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 3,265 large customers representing an increase of 28% year-over-year and a record addition of 219 large customers in the quarter. Our dollar-based net retention was 110% during the third quarter, representing a decrease of 2 percentage points sequentially. The decline in D&R was driven by slower net expansion in our larger customer cohort increased platform deals in the form of cooler funds contracts, which, as a reminder, reduce friction to adoption across our product portfolio that can impact the shape of review recognition as well as deferred revenue, TRPO and cash flow and anniversarying the price increase to our Pro and business [payroll] (ph) plans last year. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect new customers to contribute a higher percentage of our overall year-over-year revenue growth for the next several quarters. Moving to gross margin. Third quarter gross margin was 78.8% and representing a decrease of 20 basis points sequentially and an increase of 10 basis points year-over-year. Network CapEx represented 10% of revenue in the third quarter. During the quarter, we saw a notable shift in customer conversations and buying behavior from AI trading to AI inference, including our first multimillion dollar workers AI contract. This gives us confidence to continue to increase our investment in higher-end GPUs as well as the breadth of our GPU rollout as we provision greater capacity to support demand in 2025. As. A result, we continue to expect network CapEx to increase again in the fourth quarter to reach 10% to 12% of revenue for the full year 2024. Turning to operating expenses. Third quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 2% year-over-year to 64% as we remain committed to driving higher productivity and greater efficiency across our operations. Our total number of employees increased 18% year-over-year, bringing our total headcount to about 4,200 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $160.2 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased to 37% from 38% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $70.5 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 16% compared to the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $45 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 10% from 11% in the same quarter last year. Operating income was $63.5 million, an increase of nearly 50% year-over-year compared to $42.5 million in the same period last year. Third quarter operating margin was 14.8%, an increase of 210 basis points year-over-year. These results highlight our continued focus on becoming more efficient and more productive given that operational excellence is a long-term competitive advantage. Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $72.6 million or diluted net income per share of $0.20. Maintaining our strong commitment to being fiscally responsible and acting as good stewards of investors' capital we ended the third quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $45.3 million in the quarter or 11% of revenue compared to $34.9 million or 10% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, came in at $1.53 billion. representing an increase of 6% sequentially and 39% year-over-year. Current RPO was 70% of total RPO. Moving to guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. We are pleased with our execution during the third quarter, and we remain prudent in our outlook for 2024 and as we reach a key inflection point in our go-to-market transformation. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $451 million to $452 million. representing an increase of 25% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect operating income in the range of $57 million to $58 million, and we expect an effective tax rate of 16%. We expect diluted net income per share of $0.18, assuming approximately 360 million shares outstanding. For the full year 2024, we expect revenue in the range of EUR 1.661 billion to $1.662 billion, representing an increase of 28% year-over-year. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $220 million to $221 million, and we expect an effective tax rate of 13% for 2024. We expect diluted net income per share over that period to be $0.74, assuming approximately 357 million shares outstanding. As mentioned last quarter, we continue to analyze our ability to implement certain tax planning strategies in order to manage current and future cash tax liabilities. We will provide an update once this tax planning review is completed, if the outcome were to impact our expectations for Cloudflare's non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter. Regardless of the outcome, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19% to 22% beginning in 2025. However, I would remind everyone that we still have significant net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit attributes are available to offset cash taxes in the future. We expect free cash flow to be consistent with our prior guidance of approximately $160 million to $164 million for the full year 2024. In closing, our teams remain committed to driving operational excellence, ensuring long-term growth and delivering significant shareholder value. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication to our mission as well as our customers for trusting us to help them modernize, transform and secure their businesses. And with that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Matthew, please go ahead.
Matthew Hedberg: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Congrats on the results. Matthew, maybe I'll start with you. In the past, you've talked about sort of the crystal ball nature of Cloudflare. And I guess I'm wondering, when you look into that crystal ball now, what is it telling you about the external business environment? And then perhaps could you give a bit more color on -- maybe even the quantity of the U.S. based slip deals?
Matthew Prince: Yes. Matt, first of all, thank you for the question. I am not shy about talking about what we see or talking about macro concerns that are out there. I don't think that we see anything that is worse than in fact, I think we see an environment that maybe is ever have slightly improved. We saw real strength actually in Europe. I know a number of other companies haven't seen the same, but we executed well there and continue to see strength there. Asia has performed very well. And actually, from everything we've seen in the crystal ball, North America is -- has leveled off to slightly improved. I think we're where we have room to improve ourselves and where I'm optimistic looking forward is around our own internal execution. It has nothing to do with the macro. And the good news is that with our team in Europe, which has seen the most consistent sales productivity over the last eight quarters, I've had sales productivity increased by 22% year-over-year in Q3. They are running the playbook that we're running now in North America. There's a smaller team, so it's faster for us to be able to make those changes, but that's work. Same thing in Asia where they saw actually a sales productivity bump of 40% over the past 3 quarters. and they had the highest productivity of any region this year. So I think the macro -- I don't think there's anything about the macro that gives us more pause today than before. If anything, I think it's improving. And what I'm very optimistic about is that the places where we've already gotten through our improvement of our go-to-market team, we're seeing the benefits of that. And now we're rolling that out to our largest market, and we see that in Q1, you see a dramatic increase starting in the number of ramped reps and that gives me a lot of confidence and the consistency of the macro also allows us to invest with confidence.
Matthew Hedberg: Got it. Thanks. Maybe just a quick one, a follow-up for Thomas. The pool of fund deals seems like it's pressuring NRR, maybe even CRPO in revenue. Is there a way or I guess, how would you have us think through the impact of that, especially as we kind of think towards 2025? I know it's a short-term thing, and it certainly benefits the long-term model, but any sort of guidepost that you can give us on the relative impact?
Thomas Seifert: Yes. We gave a couple of that on the call. So the share of cooler funds deals in the quarter now creep up to 10%, which is a good result. It will pressure as you rightfully said, in the short term, but I think it takes friction out of the process for our customers consuming our products and services moving forward. So we think that this is going to be with us for the next two to three quarters, but provides all the upside from an expansion of the decrease of freedom we have and our customers have to expand moving forward.
Matthew Hedberg: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo. Andrew, please go ahead.
Andrew Nowinski: Okay. Good afternoon and congrats on the nice quarter. I want to start with a question on your AI. So you mentioned that a number of conversations with customers began to shift this quarter from AI training to AI inference, and I think you signed a large workers AI deal. Just give any more color on the AI landscape and some of the feedback you're hearing on Workers AI?
Matthew Prince: Yes, Andy. Thanks for the question. I'm really amazed at how quickly the AI platform that we launched is taking off and how many people are getting real value from it. And so as we mentioned, one of the leading AI companies signed a $7 million one year contract with us to move their inference to our platform. What they saw was that they were able to get significantly better performance while also being able to run at a much higher ROI on the investment that they made over what they were seeing, trying to manage it themselves through hyperscale public cloud. That's a story that is playing out over and over again. I think it's a story that is accelerating. And in order to support that, we have made the investments to increase not only just the number, but also the power of the GPUs that we're deploying around the world. What I think is unique about Cloudflare is two things. One, we are actually able to deliver inference incredibly close to where anyone is on earth because we've deployed the inference capabilities across at this point, nearly all of our network. But in addition to that, we've actually done the work to get higher utilization out of those same GPU resources where what we see when we survey customers that are trying to manage this themselves, through hyperscale public cloud is that they're getting utilization rates that are sort of in the 5% to 10% range of the resources that they're buying. We're able to deliver much higher utilization. And in the process of that, that means that we can actually pass on the effective savings to our customers. So they not only save in not having to maintain their own team to manage these virtual machines and containers, but they also save because we can just do more with the same GPU resources that are being deployed. So I'm incredibly excited that this is something which I think we have sort of started -- we're starting to shift to people who have built their models and how they actually want to deploy them in customer-facing ways. And when they do that, I think Workers AI is the most powerful platform to be able to deliver inference tasks at a global level.
Andrew Nowinski: Thank you. That was really helpful. And then I guess as my follow-up, I wanted to ask about just the team you've built. I think you've done a really nice job building out one of the best management teams in the industry and including the recent hire of CJ. So and you seem to find a new way to use your network with a new product every quarter, but I'm wondering if you can give us any color in terms of the direction that CJ wants to take Cloudflare's product development?
Matthew Prince: Yes. I'm just really honored by the caliber of people who have chosen to take the next stage of their career and bet on Michelle and my vision for the future of what Cloudflare is. And so Mark Anderson, CJ Desai, Stephanie Collin, and it goes down the list of top both managers but then also top individual contributors the caliber of talent that we get is remarkable. We're on pace to probably have over 1.5 million applicants that apply to work at Cloudflare in 2024. And we're just getting the cream of the crop of people. Those are obviously names that you all recognize. But across our entire team, I did an orientation session today, and it was just remarkable to see all of the people who are betting on Cloudflare's vision. And that gives me an enormous amount of hope that we will continue to be able to drive incredible innovation over the long term. I think CJ really brings a number of different things. One of them that I really love is his understanding and focus on the enterprise. And so, as we are building out a go-to-market team that is now able to sell very large deals to very important customers. What I referenced in my prepared remarks was that, that would then put pressure on our product and engineering team to make sure that they could deliver those enterprise-class features to satisfy what our sales team delivered. And see, there's no one in the world who is better at that than CJ. And so we're honored to have him on board. The team is incredibly excited to be working with him. And I think just watch this space because there's going to be a lot of exciting development to come.
Andrew Nowinski: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark, please go ahead.
Mark Murphy: Thank you very much. I'll add my congrats, and I agree with Andy that I think CJ is just an incredible hire. Matthew, it seems like you're capable of adding about 100,000 new developers per month, I believe, onto the platform. I think you crossed 2 million or 3 million developers. And now you have vectorized, you have hyperdrive. There's so many new products. The stats out there, there are 30 million to 100 million developers depending on how you define it. How many of those do you think are viable candidates for Cloudflare? And what do you think is attainable over time? And then I have a quick follow-up.
Matthew Prince: Yes. I mean, I think all of them are viable candidates for Cloudflare. And we want to make the platform support any of their needs. That doesn't mean that every application is going to make sense to run on Cloudflare. If you have a legacy application, if you're trying to run SAP HANA, we're not the right place to do that. But if you're the company that's building the thing that's going to disrupt SAP HANA, then we're absolutely the place to do that. And so if you look across the AI ecosystem, if you look across the sort of blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem. If you look across anywhere where someone is able to start with a blank slate, we're seeing adoption rates in the top start-ups, top companies in those spaces that are well north of 50%, and in some cases, well north of 25% of the industry. So what we think the excitement around the platform is palpable, and it has again taken off much faster. I think our secret is that customer zero for everything that we do at Cloudflare is Cloudflare ourselves. And that's been a great formula. If we build things that our own developers want it turns out a lot of other developers want to develop the same way that Close does. And that's driving, I think, a lot of excitement and a lot of interest in the platform.
Mark Murphy: Thank you. I appreciate that. As a follow-up, there have been a couple of comments now that the AI models are advancing so fast as they're actually doubling every 6 months. which is hard to believe they're advancing so fast and now I think we're looking at the reasoning and the long-duration inference. We're starting to hear the inferencing is going to have to be [multimodal] (ph) and using InfiniBand. It's a pretty big step up. And so I'm just curious maybe how you see that developing? And how might that play into your architecture as these models just become so much more demanding?
Matthew Prince: I think that we're really good at figuring out how to make very complicated, hard cash distributed across our network. And so far, what we're seeing is that even in cases where there are models that maybe need more than 1 machine to run we've been able to very efficiently do the hard engineering work to split that apart in ways that often might be different than how some others are approaching it, but get a much higher level of utilization. At the core of Cloudflare, the first thing that we really did was we've built a network where we could move data faster, more reliably, more efficiently, meaning cheaper and more securely than anyone else. And that then means that we can oftentimes take an inference task, maybe the big inference task is going to take some time. It might be that we don't answer it as close to the user as possible. It might be that we spread that out across multiple different machines and then pull the answer back. And those might be on the other side of the earth in some cases. And so that network and that ability for us to utilize the entire network we have and effectively squeeze as much efficiency out and squeeze as much utilization out as possible. that's been key to what we've done across the board with CPUs, with memory, with storage, with networking and now we're running the same play with GPUs. And so, so far, there haven't been -- we have not hit limits that our engineering team hasn't found ways around. And I think that we're -- we feel pretty optimistic that even as AI continues to accelerate, the place that you're going to want to do inference is on Cloudflare's network.
Mark Murphy: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead.
Brent Thill: Thanks. Good afternoon. Matthew, just on the go-to-market changes. There have been questions just in terms of when you talk about the pushouts, we always see this and you've seen this in past quarters. Was this quarter more pronounced on the pushouts? Or is this just something you're commenting, hey, made some sales changes this is the natural side effect. I think was kind of just curious about the magnitude of that push. Was that greater or kind of equal to what you've seen historically in past quarters?
Matthew Prince: I think that it was -- I think that what we saw this quarter that was a little bit different as we started to see the capacity held it back at some level. And that we had had to, especially in North America cut deeper than I think we initially expected. And Mark, I think, did a great job with performance management coming in and continue to do the hard work, finding the really great people on our team and make sure that they were taken care of, but also finding people that weren't going to be up to snuff and move them off the team. What I think is the big change, though, is I think we see the inflection point for that, and we've crossed it, we're really starting in Q1 the capacity. And we know that that's going to tick up because those are people who are already on the team. They're just ramping, right? And we know what the ramp rates are. We know how that builds. The capacity starts to really tick up in Q1. And assuming we're continuing to be able to hire the plan, which we expect we'll be able to given the caliber and quality of the candidates that we get, that continues to tick up over the course of 2025. So I don't think there was something that was dramatically different. I do think that we have made the productivity gains we've seen the success in other regions, and now we're bringing that to what is our largest market, which is North America. And we see again that inflection point in the not-too-distant future.
Brent Thill: Okay. And you called out Workers and you've been talking about this for a while but I guess how important is this now in the overall platform shift in adoption? How are you seeing this as customers are coming to you for multiple things. Are you seeing this as a big add-on big driver? How would you characterize where we're at in the adoption of Workers?
Matthew Prince: Yes. I think that I have -- we -- at Cloudflare, we always think that we're stacking different S curves one behind another. So we have older products that are in more mature markets. that are sort of at the tail end of their S curve. And those are great products, and we win a lot of deals from those. And those customers because we're best of breed in that often then adopt other parts of that. I think our -- where we're right in the sort of hockey stick growth, and we're seeing a lot of success is with our zero trust products, which are taking off. With Workers, I think that we are -- I keep thinking we're kind of in the beginning of that the S curve of growth. But before the S curve even in the beginning is steeper than I imagined and there's a lot that's there. But we are not, I would say, optimizing this as much for how do we extract the most revenue. I think we're still optimizing very much for adoption. And what I like is that oftentimes Workers becomes the conversation around how we actually adopt the entire platform because people want -- they want to sign a pool of funds deal because their developers are excited about what Workers delivers they don't know exactly how much of it they're going to use. They know that they're going to use the overall platform. But Workers has been oftentimes a place where people say, listen, I want to put this in place. I want to make sure Workers is part of that. And then oftentimes, we're finding that customers will use up their entire pool of funds well before the contract duration and oftentimes, what's driving that and just the excitement of their teams around building new tools on Workers.
Brent Thill: Thank you.
Phil Winslow: Just one moment, we are having connection problem with the operator.
Operator: Sorry, everyone, for the confusion and delay. Okay. For the next question, we have Shaul Eyal with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Shaul Eyal: Thank you. Hi, good afternoon, everybody. Congrats on a very solid performance. For Thomas or Matthew, there's no question, the number of seven digit and probably eight digit transactions are on the rise. We've seen some companies, some security-related companies, assisting larger customers with financing-related activities. What's the current thinking along these lines? Is it something that your customers are beginning to talk to you about what would be the approach here? Thank you.
Matthew Prince: I guess I can take a stab at it, and then Thomas might have more. And Shaul, you're saying like financing so that they could spread payments out over a longer period of time? Or can you say more about what you -- what exactly are you thinking about -- saying about?
Shaul Eyal: Actually, as they grow with you and want to consume more of your services at times, and as get addicted to some of your services, they would add -- they would probably ask for flexibility assistance in terms of payments or maybe kind of asking you to utilize some of your balance sheet in their favor.
Matthew Prince: Yes. We don't -- I mean, Thomas can add more, but we don't do any customer financing today. I think we have generally been the highest ROI provider. And because we're a SaaS service, you pay for it as you consume. I think that's often been different with hardware companies that might have a different model, but that isn't something that I'm aware of that there's a lot of demand for on our side. And Thomas, I don't know if there's anything you'd add?
Thomas Seifert: To finance customers doing business with us, this has not been a topic so far.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Tim, please go ahead.
Timothy Horan: Hi, guys. There's a lot of moving parts, obviously, with the sales productivity and limited capacity there in the pooling. Can you maybe talk about the timing of when revenue growth can accelerate again. Do you think the fourth quarter around 25% guide, is that the bottom? Or do you think it's still a few more quarters out? And related to this, can you update us on what you think the timing of for the $5 billion revenue target that you have? And I had a quick product follow-up. Thank you.
Thomas Seifert: Yes. Thank you for the question. As we said before, for us, in our subscription business model, revenue is very much a lagging metric. Sales capacities is a product of the amount of headcount we have and the productivity progress they are making, this translates into pipeline and sales prospects, turns into ACV and then ACV is recognized ratably over the lifetime of the contract as revenue. So it's very much a lagging indicator. And as we said before, models like this, there are slow on their way down, but they're also slowing their way up. But the important part is, as you heard in Matthew's prepared remarks that we think we have reached this key inflection point with net sales capacity now, which is the leading growth indicator have been patent. So from there on, we expect sales activity translating the ACV moving forward and going up. And you see this already in those parts of the world where this conversion and transition has happened successfully. Revenue was up 38% already in APAC, and it was up 1% in Europe, which is our highest productivity region has been over the last several quarters. So we think we have bottomed out from a net sales capacity perspective, and move forward from there.
Timothy Horan: And the $5 billion target may be what year? And then just on the product side, have you improved the process on going general availability with products? I know in the past, it took a little longer than expected. And I guess related to this, when do you think containers can hit GA? Thanks.
Matthew Prince: [Multiple Speakers] Yes. I would say I don't think that we wouldn't say things have taken longer than expected. I think that our strategy has always been to get products into the market as quickly as possible. Let people play with them and test them and use them, understand that they will be early products. And that's part of the power of having the millions of customers, tens of millions of customers that we do is that we can do that and get immediate product feedback and then iterate quickly and then use the GA process as a time to signal when it's the right time for products to be put in production used by our largest customers and have the confidence around. I think that has slowed down or accelerate. I think it's kind of always been the process that we've gone through. Some products take longer, some products take less time. Containers are already in market. We have a number of large customers that use them to do interesting things. How broadly we make that available is something that we are very much testing what I think doesn't make sense is to just release a product that doesn't have any differentiation doesn't have any advantage over existing container solutions. And so that's, I think, what we are talking to customers about. I think we're using our usual process. But Technically, there's nothing that keeps us from launching that tomorrow. I think what we want to do is make sure that when we do that it has such a compelling value proposition that it just becomes a no-brainer for people to use. Q - Timothy Horan Well, the strategy is working. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein with Truist Securities. Joel, please go ahead.
Joel Fishbein: Thank you. Thanks for the question. Matthew, love to get an update from you on the public sector. Obviously, you've got [indiscernible] certification. You've seen some very good customers there. I just love to hear what's happening there. And then also as it relates to that, where they are, do you think they are in their adoption of inference? That would be really helpful. Thanks.
Matthew Prince: Yes. I think that public sector has been -- was really an area of strength for us in 2023. We have not -- it has not -- it continues to perform, but it hasn't I would say, been in 1 of our standout star. I think that, that is because we've been nurturing relationships, and I think that you'll see it reemerge as a real driver of growth for us going forward. But I think it has not been much of a standout as it was last year. I also -- what is -- I'm constantly reminded of is how the people who work in governments are almost by definition, mission-driven and they really appreciate the work that we do. And so the number of notes that I've gotten from very senior people across the U.S. government, thanking us for what we did around the election, making sure that any time there was a problem they knew that they could call on our team that we had people available 24 hours a day to help with any county official in any state, anywhere in the country that we're seeing some type of an attack. And I'm proud of what we've done with that. That is the most effective marketing that we can do for our public sector business. And what we find time and time again is that as we do those good works, it turns into significant deals for us going forward. And so I think that it will be a very big -- it will continue to be a big and growing part of our business. And we have the pieces in place now that there are really no roadblocks from us winning more federal business.
Joel Fishbein: And do you feel like you have a sales capacity necessary there to hit that market?
Matthew Prince: I think we're building that sales capacity out. I think we've got some really amazing leaders there. And I think that what Mark Anderson, the person who's now leading North America for us [indiscernible], who's got an enormous sort of pedigree of selling into federal markets. And we have reps that we've hired to cover that space and they're ramping. And I think that you'll see them be able to again deliver very large deals. I don’t think that we are right now capacity constrained in the federal space.
Joel Fishbein: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Jonathan, please go ahead.
Jonathan Ho: Hi, good evening. Just wanted to get a little bit more color from some of the product side of things and particularly those around sort of the data orientation. Can you maybe give us a sense of how R2 and D1 are faring within your customer base? And whether these products are helping drive some of the growth around AI and sort of the inference modeling as well? Thank you.
Matthew Prince: Yes. I think that R2 definitely is -- the magic continues to be that if you have a large data set and you need to move it to wherever there is excess GPU capacity that R2 is an ability to do that. And so I think that, especially in training workloads, we're seeing be something that is often the gateway into using the rest of Cloudflare. And then that is helping us win more and more of the AI workloads, especially on the inference side. I think D1, there is less that's driving in the AI space directly. It is more of a traditional SQL database. But I think these components together -- have come together where now people are building full applications on top of platform workers. So you need a database, you need an object store, you need all of these primitives and these primitives together are allowing us to win much more complicated applications, much more complicated workloads, and that's important. And we continue to innovate in that space. I think what we did with HyperDrive some of the announcements we had around Birthday Week, with Durable Objects and Durable Databases are really very unique primitives that you can only get on Cloudflare. And I think you're going to start to see applications that just would have been prohibitively difficult to build in the past, especially around synchronization worldwide. A lot of game companies are starting to use some of these primitives to be able to think their player states and things that were in the past, extremely difficult to build. That is something that I think you're going to see more and more applications that just couldn't be built anywhere other than Cloudflare. And that's -- I think that's incredibly exciting for the space.
Jonathan Ho: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: There's no further question at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Matthew Prince for closing remarks. Matthew?
Matthew Prince: Thank you. We had a number of technical difficulties. I'm not going to try and take it personally that the afterhours stock went up the most when we were mute for a period of time. But I do appreciate all of the work that goes into not just these calls but really pulling together these quarters. We've got an incredible team that just continues to execute. That team is building and ramping now. And I just want to say thank you to everyone for all of the hard work over the course of the last quarter, especially over the course of this week, where we've been all hands on deck to make sure that the U.S. election went off without cyberattacks being a big part of it. Thank you so much, and we'll see you back here again next quarter.
Operator: That concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",split transcript is available for premium subscribers only.,NET
2025-02-06,"Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cloudflare, Inc. Q4 2024 Earnings Call. This conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to Mr. Phil Winslow. Please go ahead, sir.
Phil Winslow: Thank you for joining us today to discuss Cloudflare, Inc.'s financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024. With me on the call, we have Matthew Prince, Co-founder and CEO, Michelle Zatlyn, Co-founder and President, and Thomas Seifert, CFO. By now, everyone should have access to our earnings announcement. This announcement, as well as our supplemental financial information, may be found on our investor relations website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements during today's discussion, including but not limited to our customers, vendors, and partners, operations, and future financial performance, anticipated product launches, and the timing and market potential of those products. Our anticipated future financial and operating performance, and our expectations regarding future macroeconomic conditions. These statements and other comments are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainty, much of which is beyond our control. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any of our forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future. We undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could impact our future operating results and financial condition, please see our filings with the SEC, as well as in today's earnings press release. Unless otherwise noted, all numbers we talk about today other than revenue will be on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. You may find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures that are included in our earnings release on our investor relations website. For historical periods, a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in the supplemental financial information referenced a few months ago. We would also like to inform you that we will be participating in the Morgan Stanley Technology Media Telecom Conference on Monday, March 3rd, and we are hosting our annual investor day on Wednesday, March 12th. Now with that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Matthew.
Matthew Prince: Thank you, Phil. We had a very strong end to 2024. We achieved revenue of $459.9 million, up 27% year over year. During the quarter, we added a record number of new large customers, those that pay us more than $100,000 per year, and now have 3,497 large customers, also up 27% year over year. Revenue contribution from large customers grew to 69% of revenue, up from 66% in the fourth quarter last year. Our dollar-based net retention ticked up one percentage point quarter over quarter to 111%. Our gross margin was 77.6%, remaining above our long-term target range of 75% to 77%. We delivered an operating profit of $67.2 million, representing an operating margin of 14.6%. We continue to generate strong free cash flow, achieving $47.8 million during the quarter and $166.9 million for the full year. As we have talked about multiple times since the beginning of 2024, customers have been disciplined with their budgets, scrutinizing deals carefully, and ensuring every dollar spent delivered clear and immediate value. That trend continued through Q4. However, as the quarter progressed, we saw encouraging signs that confidence is beginning to return, particularly in the US. Security, AI, modernization, and efficiency form the word cloud we hear most often in these conversations. These themes play directly to Cloudflare, Inc.'s strength. Beyond the qualitative, we saw measurable improvements in Q4. We saw a notable uptick in close rates, and we saw an improvement in sales cycles. The majority of large customers I mentioned last quarter whose deals had slipped from Q3 reengaged and signed significant contracts in Q4. We crossed three million active developers on our platforms, including Cloudflare Workers and Workers.ai, and we saw a record growth in our largest customers, those that spend over a million dollars with Cloudflare, Inc. per year. We ended the year with 173 such customers, 55 of which we added in 2024, and more than half of the new adds in the fourth quarter alone. I'm proud of how our team remained disciplined and focused on delivering real ROI for customers, which drove these record results in the fourth quarter while also ensuring we are well-positioned to capture the demand we see lined up in 2025. More than anything, behind the success is our improved go-to-market execution. I wanted to give you an update on our progress on that front. Mark Anderson continues to prove he's one of the best go-to-market leaders in the industry. In the fourth quarter, he led the team to a fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year increases in sales productivity. For the full year, not only was the average productivity higher each quarter compared with 2023, but we also achieved meaningful improvements in shifting account executives to the right of their attainment graph. We delivered a ten percentage point increase in ramped AEs achieving over 80% of quota compared with 2023, with most gains coming in the 125% or higher attainment cohort. We continue to aggressively hire in our sales organization with a focus on more stage-appropriate talent and onboarding enterprise account executives with proven track records. In Q4, nearly 80% of our new sales hires were in the enterprise segment, and the absolute number of new enterprise AEs hired increased 84% year over year. You've heard me say in the past, we're not limited by our total addressable market, by our competitors, or by our pipeline. Each day, I see evidence this is truer than ever before. Our constraint has been, and at least for another quarter, will continue to be the capacity of our sales force. Now we've seen the increase in our sales force's performance under Mark's leadership. Net sales capacity turned the corner exiting 2024. In Q2 of 2025, we'll start to see capacity and ramp reps begin to meaningfully accelerate. To give you a sense, 80% of our full-year plan for 2025 is assigned to account execs who are already in their seats at Cloudflare, Inc. at the start of the year. And now that we've got the formula dialed in, keeping our foot on the gas. This is what gives me confidence in our ability to reaccelerate growth this year. We are world-class in product innovation. We are world-class in network stability and reliability. And 2025 is the year we will prove we can be world-class in go-to-market as well. That seems like a great segue to discuss some of our customer wins in the quarter. A Fortune 100 technology company signed a five-year $20 million pool of funds contract, which includes all Cloudflare, Inc. products for frictionless adoption across our entire platform, marking the largest new customer win in Cloudflare, Inc.'s history. Expected initial use cases include application security and performance, as well as our workers' developer platform. They view Cloudflare, Inc. as a strategic partner with a shared vision for multi-cloud security AI, and data sovereignty. This is just the beginning with this customer. A leading AI company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, Inc. signing a one-year $13.5 million pool of funds contract. Deploying the strategic pool of funds structure will provide seamless access to the entire Cloudflare, Inc. platform, maximizing scale, and enabling accelerated innovation with transparent pricing and a streamlined partnership. In the words of the customer, quote, Cloudflare, Inc. is a model partner. We wish to emulate this relationship with all our vendors. A leading global retailer signed a three-year $10.8 million contract for application services, workers, R2, magic firewall, and magic transit. This customer was looking for a strategic partner who could help further develop and scale its online experience which has been experiencing significant growth. Displacing a twenty-year incumbent, Cloudflare, Inc.'s unified offering and vast global presence combined with our innovative developer platform, including workers' AI, proved to be key differentiators from the incumbent and other competitors. A major US investment firm expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, Inc. signing a three-year $4 million SaaS contract for zero trust and data loss prevention along with Magic WAN and Magic Firewall. This customer approached Cloudflare, Inc. unhappy with their incumbent solution from a first-generation zero trust provider. Cloudflare, Inc. won against multiple competitors due to our superior network performance ability to deliver a transformational single vendor SaaS solution on an easy-to-use unified platform. A global 2000 aviation group signed a five-year $9.4 million contract for a full suite of applications security and performance products. This customer is focused on adopting a cloud-first operating model to increase agility while also improving cost efficiency. The company conducted a robust RFI against more than a dozen vendors in consideration, and Cloudflare, Inc. was selected to displace a long-time incumbent due to our ability to drive greater modernization, the ease of use and flexibility of our products, and our ability to deliver meaningful ROI. A global 2000 financial institution signed a four-year $13.6 million contract for application services along with Magic Transit and Threat Intelligence. This customer is looking to accelerate digital transformation as well as gain more control and transparency over its security posture. With their nine-year incumbent provider, it would take fourteen weeks to provision a new website. With Cloudflare, Inc., a new website can be provisioned in just ten minutes. In the words of this customer, quote, Cloudflare, Inc. stands out in this space, offering a robust scalable, and developer-friendly edge security platform that not just offers best-in-class security for our digital channels, but also helps us increase the velocity of digital changes to speed up the bank. A rapidly growing technology company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, Inc., signing a two-year $1 million contract for Cloudflare Calls. Cloudflare Calls is a newer product on our developer platform allowing developers to build real-time audio and video applications on Cloudflare, Inc.'s serverless edge. This customer was looking for a more cost-effective and performance solution. With Cloudflare, Inc., the customer was able to build new custom use cases that can scale significantly while also achieving better performance at a lower price point. Finally, a major international financial institution expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, Inc., signing a three-year $6.1 million contract for application services. This customer is migrating from a hyperscaler to Cloudflare, Inc. in order to enable a multi-cloud architecture as they scale their growth in a regulated industry around the world. Cloudflare, Inc.'s best-of-breed security product, higher uptime, and ease of use to scale and automate operation made us the clear winner. I wanted to end by talking a little bit about what we're seeing in AI. We believe Cloudflare, Inc. has four distinct opportunities in AI. The first is the same as every other company. We're getting more efficient in our business processes using AI systems. That's not particularly interesting these days. Though I'm proud, more often than not, we're finding we can build these functions on our own infrastructure rather than contracting with others. The second is AI makes our performance and security products smarter for customers. At some level, although we never really had the hubris to describe it this way, Cloudflare, Inc. has always been an AI company. The thesis was that if we could get enough Internet traffic flowing through us, we could spot security threats that no one else could see. And today, our machine learning-based security systems regularly discover new security threats that no human had identified before. That's again, feels like table stakes for us. The third opportunity is where I think things start to get interesting. The killer application for Cloudflare Workers is turning out to be AI. The model of programming is uniquely suited for building tools like AI agents. Our serverless architecture, which allows you to pay only for what you use, based on CPU or GPU type, positions workers to become the go-to platform for developers who want the best price performance for AI inference and genic workflows. I talked last quarter about a large AI customer that was building their interface on top of our inference platform. From their perspective, the partnership has gone extremely well. But behind the scenes, our team has been able to do the hard engineering work to drive up those efficient use of our GPU infrastructure. Inference paths are generally highly variable. And there's a two-time difference between this customer's peaks and valleys, which means they would have to pay approximately 250% more to save provision on a hyperscaler to run the same number of inference tasks compared with workers' AI Efficient. Pay for inference serverless model. Additionally, more and more developers are discovering AI gateway with some realizing more than 10x price performance improvement for their AI agents by serving requests directly from Cloudflare, Inc.'s cache instead of the original model provider. And just last month, the world was amazed at the efficiency the team of clever engineers in China were able to deliver in the field of AI training with the deep seek model. We are seeing that there are equivalent optimizations that can be made with AI inference on Cloudflare, Inc.'s platform, resulting in faster performance and lower prices for customers and higher margin and less CapEx for us. We believe inference is a bigger opportunity than training and our team continues to find step function breakthroughs that put us well ahead of any alternative. But all that may pale in comparison to the fourth opportunity, Cloudflare, Inc. counts many of the most important AI companies as customers. We also count a huge portion of the world's content creators as our users. Being between those two puts us in an important role to help figure out the business model of the post-search web. Cloudflare, Inc. sits in a unique position to help figure out how content creators are compensated, what agents are allowed where and on what terms, and how the AI-driven web of the future will fit together. It's early days, but the conversations we're having with all the relevant parties feel foundational for the future. Watch this space. Definitely exciting times. But before I get too far ahead of myself, to bring it back to the present, I'm going to hand it off to Thomas to talk through the fourth quarter's financials and our outlook for 2025. Thomas, take it away.
Thomas Seifert: Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us. We're pleased with our strong operational and financial performance for the fourth quarter that incurred the momentum from our go-to-market transformation efforts that Matthew discussed. Strength in our business this quarter was driven by significant growth with large $1 million customers, ongoing traction with pool of funds contracts, sustained momentum with our workers' developer platform, and high prioritization of security by our customers. We saw a notable uptick in close rates and an improvement in sales cycles. We also delivered another double-digit year-over-year improvement in sales productivity with record productivity in both EMEA and APAC. As discussed last quarter, we were encouraged to see the number of ramped account executives increase exiting the fourth quarter and we expect year-over-year growth in ramped AEs to continue to accelerate each quarter throughout 2025, further laying the foundation for Cloudflare, Inc.'s next phase of growth at scale. Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the fourth quarter increased 27% year over year to $459.9 million. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. represented 58% of revenue and increased 27% year over year. EMEA represented 28% of revenue and increased 27% year over year. APAC represented 14% of revenue and increased 39% year over year. Turning to our customer metrics. In the fourth quarter, we had approximately 237,700 paying customers, representing a record addition of nearly 48,000 paying customers in 2024 and an increase of 25% year over year. We ended the quarter with about 3,500 large customers, representing a record addition of more than 740 large customers in 2024, an increase of 27% year over year, as well as a record addition of 232 large customers in the fourth quarter alone. We were pleased to see revenue contribution from large customers during the quarter increase again to 69% of revenue, up from 66% in the fourth quarter last year. For full year 2024, revenue from large customers represented 67% of total revenue compared with 64% in 2023 and 61% in 2022. And we ended the year with 173 customers that spent over a million dollars with us, adding a record 55 one million dollar customers in 2024, and representing a 47% increase year over year. Our dollar-based net retention was 111% during the fourth quarter, representing an increase of one percentage point sequentially. As a reminder, there can be some variability in this metric quarter to quarter, but we believe the recent decelerating trend in DNR is stabilizing despite continued near-term headwinds from increased churn, which can impact the shape of revenue recognition, especially for existing customers transitioning to these platform deals. Moving to gross margin. Fourth quarter gross margin was 77.6%, representing a decrease of 120 basis points sequentially and a decrease of 130 basis points year over year. During the fourth quarter, the percentage paid versus free customer traffic increased as compared to its prior quarters, resulting in a higher allocation of expenses to cost of goods sold from sales and marketing. The underlying economics of our network driven by inherent scalability and efficiency remained unchanged. Network CapEx represented 50% of revenue in the fourth quarter and 10% of revenue for the full year. As we mentioned last quarter, the accelerating shift from AI training to AI inference has given us confidence to continue to increase our investment in our GPU rollout. As we provision greater capacity to support demand in 2025, as a result, we expect network CapEx to be 12% to 13% of revenue for full year 2025. Turning to operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 5% year over year to 63% as we remain committed to driving higher productivity and greater efficiency across our operations. Our total number of employees increased 16% year over year, bringing our total headcount to about 4,300 at the end of the quarter. Sales and marketing expenses were $166.9 million for the quarter. Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased to 36% from 40% in the same quarter last year. Research and development expenses were $74.8 million in the quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 16% compared to the same quarter last year. General and administrative expenses were $47.8 million for the quarter. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 10% from 11% the same quarter last year. Operating income was $67.2 million, an increase of 69% year over year compared to $39.8 million in the same period last year. Fourth quarter operating margin was 14.6%, an increase of 360 basis points year over year. These results highlight our continued focus on becoming more efficient and more productive, given that operational excellence is a long-term competitive advantage. Turning to net income and the balance sheet. Our net income in the quarter was $68.8 million or diluted net income per share of $0.19. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in Q4 was 25% compared to guidance of 16% to account for the full year impact of certain tax elections made during the fourth quarter, which did not increase our cash liabilities in 2024 but expected to mitigate cash liabilities in future years. Excluding the impact of these tax elections, our reported diluted net income per share would have been $0.22 for the quarter. Maintaining our strong commitment to being fiscally responsible, we ended the fourth quarter with $1.86 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities. Free cash flow was $47.8 million in the quarter or 10% of revenue compared to $50.7 million or 14% of revenue in the same period last year. Remaining performance obligations or RPO came in at $1.687 billion, representing an increase of 12% sequentially and 36% year over year. Current RPO was 70% of total RPO, growing 30% year over year in the fourth quarter versus 29% in the third quarter and 26% in the second quarter, respectively. Moving to guidance for the first quarter and full year 2025. As a management team, we remain deeply committed to the unit economics of our business and focused on the two fundamental drivers of long-term value creation: growth and profitability. We've always taken a disciplined, data-driven approach to scaling Cloudflare, Inc., balancing investments for future expansion with financial and operational efficiency to ensure that every dollar we deploy drives significant returns in the form of durable long-term growth and profitability. Over the past two years, we've demonstrated our ability to drive operating leverage while transforming our go-to-market operations as we pursue the massive opportunities still ahead of us. Our disciplined approach gives us the flexibility to lean in when we see the right opportunities. And as we enter 2025, the data we have gives us confidence that now is the time to continue to invest to reaccelerate growth. Importantly, this will say some tangible data. We have real visibility into the factors driving growth: improving sales productivity and attainment levels, ramping capacity of account executives already in seats, building momentum with large $1 million-plus customers, growing pipeline, higher win rates, and increasing traction in key areas, including workers, AI, and SaaS. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $468 million to $469 million, representing an increase of 24% year over year. Variable revenue is still a newer recurring part of our business model. While we saw strong signals during the fourth quarter, reflecting increased usage, we're maintaining a prudent outlook for the first quarter given more limited historical data on consumption patterns and seasonality. We expect operating income in the range of $54 million to $55 million. We expect an effective tax rate of 21%. We expect diluted net income per share of $0.16, assuming approximately 362 million shares outstanding. For the full year 2025, we expect revenue in the range of $2.09 billion to $2.094 billion, representing an increase of 25% year over year. We anticipate the weighting of revenue in the second half versus the first half of 2025 to be approximately 40 to 50 basis points higher as compared with the relative mix in 2024. We expect operating income for the full year in the range of $272 million to $276 million, and we expect an effective tax rate of 21% for 2025. We expect diluted net income per share over that period to be in the range of $0.79 to $0.80, assuming approximately 366 million shares outstanding. In closing, we're excited about the road ahead and confident that our strategy will drive continued innovation and accelerating growth. As always, we'll stay focused on creating significant shareholder value with our commitment to disciplined execution, durable growth, and operational efficiency. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters as we accelerate Cloudflare, Inc.'s next stage of growth at scale. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Do ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
Hamza Fodderwala: Great. Good evening, and thank you for taking my question and congrats on the strong finish to the year. Matthew, obviously, you know, DeepSeq was a big story so far this year. I'm curious, you know, as we see the rate of improvement and the efficiency of these models, whether you think more and more of these inference workloads start moving to the edge.
Matthew Prince: Yeah. Hamza. First of all, let me apologize. I have a bit of a cough, so I'll try my best not to cough into the phone too much during this. But DeepSeq was, you know, first of all, I think there's been a lot of noise around DeepSeq, you know, because it came out of a Chinese company, I think there's a lot of concern around, you know, national security issues and other things. I think we boiled it down and looked at the underlying research behind it. And the reality from what we've seen is that the researchers at DeepSeq came up with two very, very clever optimizations that significantly reduced the cost of training. And that's I think that's really interesting if you sort of separated away from a lot of the noise. My view is that models over time will commodify and will be largely open rather than proprietary. And that's something that DeepSeq I think, is the sort of camel's nose under the tent. I think what Meta is doing in LAMA is another effort in that area. And that's good for us. That's good for Cloudflare, Inc. because we can have a broad set of models that are running on Cloudflare, Inc.'s network and available to our customers. And the second thing that was important was that DeepSeq really demonstrated that there is room for efficiency. For a while there, you know, I felt like we were the only ones saying, hey. You can make AI a lot more efficient. I think some of the folks, you know, in Cupertino, at Apple, were seeing the same thing, although are much more secretive about what they're seeing. But, you know, this idea that the only way to win an AI was to spend, you know, hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars, I think DeepSeq shook that foundation. And I think that plays very much to Cloudflare, Inc.'s strength. We are extremely good at ringing out as much efficiency as possible, and we're seeing the same opportunities with the inference that DeepSeq saw with training. And I think that that gives us a lot of confidence that models that are running on Cloudflare, Inc., they're running using our serverless platform, we're gonna be able to deliver the best price points for our customers while still having those be, you know, relatively low CapEx investments and relatively high margin for us. And, again, that's kind of Cloudflare, Inc.'s bread and butter over the last fifteen years. And finally, you know, I think that inference and agents are the really big opportunities in AI. And while a lot of the money that's been spent on it has been spent on training for the last little bit, I think as we go forward, a lot more of that money is gonna be spent on inference and agents. And, again, Cloudflare Workers is the killer application for Cloudflare Workers. Is inference. It is agent. And we're seeing more and more companies that are running with exactly that. So I think DeepSeq is across the board a positive sign for Cloudflare, Inc., and I think our team is excited not to be the only ones out there shouting that there's a lot of efficiency that we can bring out of these models.
Hamza Fodderwala: Thank you. Look forward to seeing you next month.
Operator: Up next, we'll hear from Matt Hedberg, RBC.
Matt Hedberg: Great. Thanks all for my congrats as well. A lot of good stuff, good content today. You know, I wanted to, you know, focus on the product side. CJ's well into his role. The product team's built out. You know, Matthew, you just said I'm talking about a ton of innovation around killer AI apps. And inferencing, and there's just there's there's there seems like there's a lot of really, really exciting development there. You know, if you could just step back and sort of reflect on you know, what you're most excited about from a product innovation perspective this year? Are there are there things that we should be watching, you know, for inflection points this year?
Matthew Prince: You know, I think I was just was actually at our regional sales kickoff in London with CJ and Mark this morning. And excuse me. And I think, you know, the first thing I'll say is that, you know, Cloudflare, Inc. has always been great at engineering. You know, for, I think, at least the last seven years, we've been great at a great at product. I think I'm the most excited about is that 2025 is the year where we're gonna prove that we can be world-class and go-to-market. And what I think is unique about a product and engineering leader like CJ is he is so customer-focused. It's so centered around making sure that our sales team has the tools, has the support that they need, in order to win, and you could just feel that coming through with the team in EMEA over the last two days that I was there with them. And I think that that's the thing that I'm most excited about. I think beyond that, you know, I think that AI over the last year has felt like it went from kind of an interesting, you know, science project to something that's turning into real use cases. And I think that that's gonna be the turning point here. And so I talked a time ago about how, you know, inference and agents, we really think, are the big opportunities. Some of the applications that we're seeing getting built are just really, really fascinating. You know, in finance, there's a financial service company that's built an agent to perform, you know, on Cloudflare Workers to perform diligence on M&A targets. In medicine, we got a startup that's building an AI agent to review clinical trial results. There's an upstart customer support company that built an agent to pull a comprehensive view of customers and then make sure that that's in front of the human agent that's actually supporting a customer in a really efficient way. Again, all built on workers. In CRM, you know, a customer built an agent to provide in-depth information about prospects, their businesses, the org structure, in order to make salespeople, you know, significantly more efficient. And again, you know, all on top of workers. In media, you know, an existing customer built an agent to answer questions about legal documents and marketing. A customer built an agent about researching the latest topics and creating, you know, SEO design pages to promote their product. At Cloudflare, Inc., you know, we built an instant image management agent that's saving some of its going four and six hours every single day. So I think that, you know, I know there's a lot of hype around AI. I think that over the what I and I wasn't quite sure how quickly that would turn into, you know, real ROI to customers. I think in the last couple quarters, we're starting to see where people are using workers AI to deliver real value, not just something which is a cool demo.
Matt Hedberg: Great. Great examples, Matthew. And then maybe just a quick one for Thomas. You mentioned pool of funds in your prepared remarks, is there any way that you could help us think about what the impact or quantify, you know, the impact of pool of fund deals in Q4? And, you know, when you think about its impact in 2025, how should we kind of think about guardrails for what seems like an increasing component of revenue?
Thomas Seifert: Yep. The activity around pool of funds in the fourth quarter was comparable to what we saw in the prior quarter, around nine percentage points. We're excited by this. You know, in a subscription model like ours, revenue is a lagging indicator. And the fourth quarter felt like one of these inflection points where things are lining up with sales headcount translates into activity, translates into pipeline, translates into ACV that will be, you know, ratably recognized as revenue over the course of the year, and we saw a lot of these early pointers putting in the right direction, sales capacity, sales productivity, large deals with customers north of a million dollars, and pool of funds deals. The guardrails we put in place are a mix of how we compensate and how we incentivize because the art in turning these pool of funds deals into success is you have to get customers to consume product. And I think we learned a lot over the last twelve months in dealing with these constructs and are quite confident in our outlook, how these contracts will be recognized in terms of revenue over the course of the year, especially in the second half of this year.
Matt Hedberg: Thanks a lot. Best of luck, guys.
Operator: The next question is Adam Borg, Stifel.
Adam Borg: Awesome. And thanks much for taking the question. Wanted to touch on the announcements from this week on FedRAMP high. I was just really curious, you know, what this may mean from a network architecture perspective, you know, and speaking with investors, does this mean anything around fragmenting, you know, your unique and homogeneous network? So one way of saying is this high this is a FedRAMP high that And then maybe if you could give an update on your government business more broadly just both within US and international. Thanks so much.
Matthew Prince: Sure, Adam. I'll take a stab at the first bit and a little of the second bit, and Thomas may have some more to add. You know, I think first of all, the federal business is important to us, and we want to make sure that federal customers who need protection can get that. And that means making sure that we can comply with what the requirements are. But, you know, one of the things that was important to our products and engineering team was that we did that in a way which was still inherently Cloudflare, Inc. So we didn't rush to do something that would maybe result in some, you know, quick near-term revenue that would cause us years of pain in terms of our network and our architecture over the long term. We also didn't want to make it piecemeal where some Cloudflare, Inc. products were available under FedRAMP high, but other Cloudflare, Inc. products weren't. We wanted the entire platform to be doing that. And so as a result, I think we've moved maybe a little bit more slowly and more cautiously but it's exactly in respect to your question, which is we don't want to fragment the network. And so we have designed a compliance strategy that allows us to use our existing network and be able to meet the FedRAMP high requirements. That has been an effort in both directions. You know, I remember very clearly some conversations with federal government officials where there were requirements like all machines had to be in the US since said, do you really want us to import the denial of service attack into the US before we stop it as opposed to stopping it out at the edge of the network? And I said, obviously not. That doesn't make any sense. And I think they've been willing to work with us and figure out what the right process is. But I think we've built a very, very, very good plan that allows us to run the same network and largely across the board without having to fragment it the way that some of the other hyperscalers have or build a specific gov cloud. And that is I think, what will allow us to continue to have success in the federal space while maintaining the elegance of Cloudflare, Inc.'s network architecture where literally any server anywhere on our network is capable of performing any of the functions that we need. So I think that that's powerful. In terms of the federal business, you know, the list of federal agencies that we work with continues to grow. We continue to do more and more with them in the United States. Outside the United States, that continues to be really powerful. So I was just I mentioned I was just in London. I was meeting this partner of sales, kicked off also with the CTO of NATO who is a Cloudflare, Inc. customer and really excited for what we can do for them. And, again, our team is very proud of the fact that we're helping protect so many of these critical infrastructures around the world.
Adam Borg: Awesome. Thanks so much.
Operator: The next question today is Jonathan Ho, William Blair.
Jonathan Ho: Good afternoon. How do we think about the security performance this quarter? Were there any standout product categories that you're seeing? Congrats again on the strong quarter results.
Matthew Prince: You know, I think the theme for the last couple of quarters has really been that more and more of our large customers are buying into the overall Cloudflare, Inc. platform. And so it's less about buying one particular feature and more and more buying the broad suite of everything that Cloudflare, Inc. does. That's when we say pool of funds, that's what we're really saying. It's that a customer isn't coming and saying, you know, I just want a WAF or I just want a, you know, modern VPN replacement or I just want that they're saying, we have bought into Cloudflare, Inc.'s vision for what a network architecture should look like. We don't know exactly what's gonna make sense in terms of us deploying that, but over time, we see a significant portion of our network relying on the Cloudflare, Inc. products. And so we're willing to commit a pool of funds and then draw that down as it makes sense in terms of our own deployment in order to deliver that. And so I think that broad platform and a real true platform all built on one unified architecture is what is giving us the ability to do these large pool of funds deals. And I think the theme has been largely that it's the platform that has been the killer feature that people are adopting. If you push me, more and again, I'm not still not yet, you know, from the revenue perspective, but I continue to see so many amazing things happen in our in the developer space. The fact that we crossed three million developers using the Cloudflare, Inc. platform is terrific. The pace of that growth is just accelerating. And so I think that's the area where there continues to be sort of the most excitement. And, again, it feeds into the overall platform as well.
Jonathan Ho: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: Up next, we'll take a question from Fatima Boolani, Citi.
Fatima Boolani: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Matthew, I wanted to go back to your commentary and your very emboldened stance about the go-to-market just in terms of higher aggregate sales capacity and accelerating productivity momentum into this year. So the question for you is this being year two with Mark's helm, of the whole organization and kind of doubling back to some of your comments in the prepared remarks, what changes might you be considering from a compensation or an incentives perspective to maybe balance some of that really robust pool of funds momentum, but also engender more of that mass market appeal for your growth year acts. So namely the developer services and some of the zero trust services areas that could be a real tailwind for you. Thank you.
Matthew Prince: Yeah. I'll start, and then I think Thomas will have more of the nitty-gritty details that he can share. I think that, you know, we're so we're just starting. We're I don't think we've quite come up on Mark's one-year anniversary, but it's coming up pretty soon. And I think the amount that he's accomplished in a year has been really, really amazing to watch. You know, building up his leadership really just increasing the caliber and quality of the, you know, the overall AEs, the SCs that are on the team, and then I think incredibly importantly, identifying some of the real stars that were already on our team and making sure that they get the recognition and rewards that they deserve. Part of that is definitely around thinking about, you know, things like territories being much more disciplined about how territories are assigned. Again, I was just hanging out with our EMEA sales team and all salespeople always grumble about, you know, territory assignments, at some level. But all of them said, you know what? Honestly, this is the right way to do it, and it's the fair thing to do. I think one of the things that was sometimes a challenge, you know, the blessing and the curse of Cloudflare, Inc. is everybody needs Cloudflare, Inc., which is obviously wonderful. But if you don't do territories right, the challenges you can have a salesperson actually do quite well by selling, you know, one product to a bunch of different customers as opposed to going very deep and very specific and targeted on customers. I think Mark has done the things in order to deliver that. And then as we're shifting to more pool of funds deals, you know, we're shifting away from being paid by, you know, what you sell, what your ACV is, and we're having AEs that are being paid based on the actual revenue that's recognized as products are consumed. And, again, I think that that's important just as Thomas alluded to already about making sure that our team is staying with customers, building deep relationships with them, making sure that they're getting the most out of every product that they buy from us. And, again, these are not nothing here not we're not reinventing the wheel in any way. I think we're in a place where we've got great engineering. We've got great product. And now we're doing the table stakes things to become really world-class in go-to-market as well.
Thomas Seifert: Yeah. There's not much to add to Matthew's answer. I think one of the reasons why this transformation has been so successful so far is that we avoided major disruptive moves. And what is in front of us for the remainder of the year are tweaking at the address. I think Mark and his team have done an extraordinarily good job getting everything ready as we start the year, new territories rolled out, productive AEs in place, quotas assigned, a good handle around the account structure. And avoiding really major disruptions as we move through the year. There will be, you know, slight adjustments here and there, but all the major things are in place already.
Operator: Thank you, coach. We'll go to Gabriela Borges, Goldman Sachs.
Gabriela Borges: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Matthew, I wanted to ask you the go-to-market question a slightly different way. I think about how consistently your market share for several of your products is higher at AI native companies versus the rest. How do you navigate that conversation at the enterprise level where perhaps parts of the organization may be pushing leading edge, but the rest of the organization may not be? And to what extent do you still get pushback on the depth of ecosystem on the workers' platform and how do you address that? Thank you.
Matthew Prince: Yeah. You know, I mean, the whole AI space is so new that in almost any company that you encounter, even the digital natives, you know, there will be AI evangelists and AI skeptics, and they're mixed together. I think that to start out, it starts with Cloudflare, Inc. having a very self-serve easy to use, easy for a small team to provision and experiment with, you know, low capital investment. Like, you can literally sign up with a credit card and start doing inference tasks and build a demo as a small team. And then, you know, we have let that bottoms-up approach work incredibly well for getting the adoption we have and those use cases. I think what changes in 2025 is that, you know, we're going to be much more targeted with going after, you know, specific targeted accounts where we think there's the right fit, you know, someone's already a Cloudflare, Inc. customer, they're using us in ways that they're interesting. They know us. They trust us. And so, you know, some of you have been to, like, our last investor day, Ali Cabral, who's on the PM team overseeing a lot of workers, actually, you know, switched over to the go-to-market team, and she's running what we're calling a speedboat which is targeting a handful of customers to specifically go after them and build that kind of library of case studies that are there, making sure that, you know, regardless of what size of company, regardless of what industry they're in, that we've got those case studies that we can then use to expand over time. So I think the very nature of how Cloudflare, Inc. is provisioned makes it very easy for us to go bottoms-up in a way that doesn't always require a big go-to-market effort, but then I think we're being very strategic with our go-to-market team, you know, for the first time really in saying, let's pick out the few hundred customers that we wanna win and prove those as use cases. And I'm incredibly excited for Ali and her team and what they're gonna be able to deliver because she's the right person, knows the platform extremely well, and is excited to go show people what they can build using workers.ai.
Gabriela Borges: Yeah. That makes sense. Thanks for the detail.
Operator: Up next is Trevor Walsh, Citizens JMP.
Trevor Walsh: Great. Thanks, team, for taking my questions. Matthew, you've talked a lot about agents within the context of AI today, both in remarks and comes to some of your responses to questions. Could you just expand maybe just giving a couple kind of what in your mind are the two differentiated pieces or kind of product aspects of Workers that makes it well-positioned for agents or why kind of, I guess, easy to build those there on that part of the platform. And then you spoke additionally about great examples of more startup type companies building agents to really go sell. But what about your larger customers kind of building agents internally maybe for their own use. And if that's something they're doing on workers, give me examples of kind of that type of activity happening. Thanks.
Matthew Prince: Yeah. I mean, some of the examples I gave you are actually pretty large companies. I think the difference between startups and large companies often is how much they let us talk about what they're doing. But we're seeing across the board really, really exciting things regardless of the size of companies. Startups are often just a little bit more willing to let us toot their horns. In terms of the I think that the platform question is really, really important, and it's important to think about, like, how to contrast Cloudflare Workers and Cloudflare Workers AI with what the hyperscalers are doing. So let me first walk through. Let's say that you wanted to build an agent on a hyperscaler. So the first thing is, you've got to contact them and say, listen. I need to use a machine, and the machine has to have some GPU resources. And for various reasons that are pretty technical, you have to have a full VM basically, to do that. So you essentially got to have a significant portion of the machine and in some cases rent the entire machine. And in order to get the best pricing, for that kind of the competitive pricing, you have to commit to, typically about a year of renting that machine. So got a machine. It's got, you know, an NVIDIA processor or more that are in it. You're renting it for that entire year. It is then up to you to figure out how to maximize that utilization. And it was actually interesting, you know, talking to CJ in some of the previous roles that he's been in, and he told us what I think is common across most companies, which is that most of the time when you're building anything with AI, inference the level of utilization that you're getting, you know, it maxes out at about 10% and what we hear from most people is that the average utilization is in the mid-single digits in terms of that utilization, and it kind of makes sense because, excuse me, when these agents get invoked, you don't know how when people are gonna submit queries or not and, you know, time of day makes a difference. All kinds of things make a difference in terms of when that availability is. And it's up to you. The hyperscalers, their job, their business is renting you the machine. But after you have the machine, it's up to you to get the most out of it. And so that means that, you know, it can be very, very, very expensive to have the peak capacity that you need but then waste all of that capacity when there's downtime that's out there. And so at Cloudflare, Inc., we've just always thought of it differently. We have thought that you should only pay for when you're actually getting real work done. And so we just we our business is not renting you a machine. Our business is selling you the actual inference task, the when the agent is actually invoked and it's doing work, you pay for that. If it's not, you don't pay for it at all. And so that allows you to actually, have much easier startup cost because you don't have to go and negotiate, you know, a year-long deal with, you know, Microsoft or Google or Amazon or Oracle. Instead, you can just come to us, you know, your credit card in and only pay for what you use. We tend to have pricing which is still attractive. And the question is then how? Because, again, we don't get a significant discount on the underlying GPUs. But what we are able to do is drive up that utilization. And so where a typical customer is seeing sub-10% utilization across their GPUs, our peak utilization of GPUs is now around 70%. Our average is still much lower than that. We're much better still at CPU utilization at getting an average up in the 70% range. But we see a path for us to be able to do that with GPUs as well. What that effectively means is, you know, again, roughly speaking, we can get effectively seven times today the amount of work out of a dollar of CapEx spent in this area that you can with the various hyperscalers. And, again, that either means that we can capture that as margin or we can pass that on to our customers. So at some level, what Cloudflare, Inc. has always been is a giant scheduler. We are really good at moving data and very, very, very low cost and in most cases even free around the world to wherever there are the resources to be able to process that data. And that then in the agent space, in the inference space, in all of workers, that is allowing us to have this incredibly high utilization and deliver just a much easier to get started with, easier to consume. You don't have to have a full SRE team to run your machines because we handle that all for you. So it's easier to use. It's more cost-effective. It's fairer in terms of the pricing. It scales all the way down to zero when there's nothing using it. Scales up as much as you need on the other end. And we think it's just a better model. What's also interesting is because we're inventing a lot of this IP and a lot of this tech ourselves, how you take a GPU, which was never intended to be a multi-tenant thing, and make it multi-tenant. We think that at least in the short to medium term, that's gonna give us a moat because there's a lot of hard engineering work in order to deliver that. And we just don't see any other companies that are focused on the same things that we are today.
Trevor Walsh: Awesome. Super interesting. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our final question today comes from Andrew Nowinski, Wells Fargo.
Andrew Nowinski: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Squeezing me in here. Congrats on very strong execution again. So I just wanna maybe switch topics to your SaaS solutions. I mean, there's no doubt that the network security market's transitioning to zero trust but there are, you know, a number of vendors in the space. I'd imagine a lot of the bake-offs that you're in are very competitive. So I'm just trying to parse out maybe how much of your SaaS wins are coming from the overall market inflecting higher with, you know, with greenfield opportunities versus competitive displacements? And maybe if you can give some color on why you're winning there. Thanks.
Matthew Prince: Yeah. You know, I think when we first got into space, you know, we thought that the right strategy was to go after greenfield opportunities. But what we realized pretty quickly was a lot of customers that are out there were really dissatisfied with their the sort of first-generation zero trust vendors. They didn't like their performance. They tended to have low reliability, there was a lot of arrogance in the market from certain vendors, and there was, you know, I think a feeling that there wasn't actually kind of continuous innovation in the space. And so somewhat to our surprise, we actually pivoted to going directly after a lot of people who were having problems with their first zero trust vendors that were out there. And I think where our pitch and where we end up winning time and time and time again is by saying we have the fastest network everywhere in the world. First, second, we have a comprehensive solution for your entire network, not just the zero trust piece, but for both the sort of forward proxy and reverse proxy parts, and so we can bundle that altogether. And then as a result, that bundle has a just much higher ROI than anyone else is able to deliver. And so that's been a very compelling prospect. A lot of the big zero trust wins that we're winning are a displacement of other zero trust vendors. We also are winning some of the new greenfield opportunities as well. And we continue to invest in the space. But the key here is because we have the broad platform, we're able to just solve a much more diverse set of problems for a customer than just Zero Trust. And I think that over time, you know, zero trust is a feature. What people really want is a completely secure network and Cloudflare, Inc. is by far the leader in providing that.
Andrew Nowinski: Perfect. Thank you, Matthew.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to hand the conference back over to Matthew Prince for any additional or closing remarks.
Matthew Prince: Thank you so much. I appreciate everybody tuning in. Wanted to take a second to thank our entire team for what was an incredible 2024. I think as Thomas alluded to, see the first half of 2025 being a real turning point, and I am excited for what is ahead. Thanks to the entire team. I'm excited to see a bunch of you over the weeks ahead as I travel to various sales kickoffs around the world and appreciate it and go Cloudflare, Inc.
Operator: And once again, everyone, that does conclude today's conference. We would like to thank you all for your participation today. You may now disconnect.",split transcript is available for premium subscribers only.,NET
